In its database of prints and book illustrations you will find political satires, portraits, maps, landscapes, architectural drawings, playing cards, and titlepages of books, thousands of images that show us how early modern people understood their society and their world.</p>\n            <div class=\"mt-10 text-left\">\n              <p>The database includes works by the period's leading printmakers, including Francis Barlow, Abraham Blooteling, Francis Clein, Thomas Cockson, William Faithorne, Wenceslaus Hollar, Marcellus Laroon, William Marshall, John Smith, and Robert White. It contains depictions of some of the period's main events (the Gunpowder Plot, Civil Wars, Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Restoration, Revolution of 1688, and Nine Years' War), representations of its ideas and beliefs (political protest, religion, mythology, and fables), and its understanding of the natural world (anatomy, science, animals, plants, and flowers). There are images of people (from royalty to ordinary folk), places (from palaces to alehouses), and activities (from eating and drinking to washing and shaving). The prints record the incidental details of early modern life, the clothes, objects, and wares that defined people's place in their society.</p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">In addition to the database, this website contains <router-link :to=\"{  name: 'Resources' }\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">resources</router-link> to enhance users' understanding of printed images and inspire further <router-link :to=\"{  name: 'Research' }\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">research</router-link> in the field.

The project was led by Michael Hunter (Birkbeck College, University of London) and included Stephen Pigney, Katherine Hunt, and Mary Wills as research assistants. The team worked closely with the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum and the Department of Word and Image at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Software engineering was completed by the following members of Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King's College London (now called the King's Digital Lab).       </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">The website and database were updated, redesigned, and relaunched in 2024 as part of a project on visual culture in early modern England led by <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/hca/people/profile/adammorton.html\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Morton</a> (Newcastle University) and funded by the AHRC under its Research Development and Engagement Scheme. Software and database design was undertaken by Research Software Engineering, Newcastle University.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\"> \n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">The Corpus</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">The database contains almost 11,000 prints and book illustrations (that number includes multiple states and impressions of the same print). Much of the corpus is held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, with some additional material held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Additional prints and book illustrations will be added in the future. The prints have been catalogued using terms derived and adapted from Iconclass and the Library of Congress Subject Headings. They can be searched according to Printmaker, Subject, Person, or Technique.  </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">The date 1700 is an approximate cut-off point for the corpus. Many political prints produced during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-14) are included as are those produced by printmakers whose careers spanned the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. For example, John Smith, one of the most important printmakers of the Restoration, continued to be active until his death in the early 1740s. 'British' print is also an approximate term. Most of the prints in the corpus were produced in Britain, but many were made by foreign-born artists. Prints made on the continent but depicting events in Britain (such as Dutch satires on the Anglo-Dutch wars or Revolution of 1688) are also included.</p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">\n                Despite its size, the database is not a complete record of the period's printed imagery. Prints are dispersed in collections across the world, and no one repository can hope to achieve completion. Printed ballads are largely absent from the corpus (see the <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Bodleian Library's Broadside Ballad</a> project for access to that material), as are most of the early modern period's book illustrations (though a catalogue of those produced between 1604-1640 is available). Finally, although many of Hollar's works are in this database, there are absences in the corpus. The University of Toronto's <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"https://hollar.library.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Wenceslaus Hollar Digital Collection</a> is an excellent resource for those wishing to look further. \n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>  \n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-1xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-xl text-left\">Copyright</h3>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">All images in the database are subject to copyright.

Much of the material here has not been studied before, and that which has is always open to new interpretations. </p>\n            <div class=\"mt-10 text-left\">\n                <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900\">Designing your project</h2>\n                 <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    How you use the database depends on the nature of your research project. Are visual materials the main body of primary sources in your dissertation? Or are they a supplementary one, a type of source you are drawing on alongside other types of material? Both are valid types of research projects, but how you draw on the prints in the Bpi1700 may be different in each project.</p>\n\n                 <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-1xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 italic\">Basing a dissertation on prints.</h3>\n\n                 <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    There are lots of ways that you might do this. First, it is essential to consider what you want the subject of your research project to be (and  why). Will you focus on:</p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">A period or event?</span> Perhaps you are interested in the role of images at specific moments? Coronations or royal weddings, for example. Or during moments of political crisis? The Exclusion Crisis (1678-82) or the Revolution of 1688 produced many political prints. You may even wish to be more specific and consider one aspect of those sources. The role of Dutch prints in British politics, for example. Searching for Romeyn de Hooghe would be a good place to start.</li>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">An artist or publisher?</span> Perhaps you want to focus on the prints made by one engraver or publisher. Will you trace developments? Explore themes in their work? Or, perhaps, place them in an artistic or cultural context? There are plenty of engravers to choose from - the <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"/resources/directories\" target=\"_blank\"> Printmakers directory</a> is a good place to look. Alternatively, you may want to think about how the work of a painter (Godfrey Kneller or Peter Lely, perhaps) was disseminated in prints. </li>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">A theme or topic?</span> Perhaps you are interested in how early modern people understood their world. The subject search will help you here. You will be able to find prints depicting the natural world (plants, flowers, animals, birds, agriculture, and so on). These make up a significant part of the archive. Perhaps you are interested in how ethnicity or nationality was understood in the period? Prints depicting non-Europeans and different European nationalities will be a useful way in thinking about this. </li>\n                </ul>\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    This approach allows you to identify a discrete body of source material quite quickly. This will give your research project definable parameters. The next stage will be to move on to analysing and contextualising the sources. This is the trickier (and more fun) part of the research process, and there are plenty of <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"/resources\" target=\"_blank\">resources</a> on this website to help. The first step is to establish what it is you want to know? What questions are you asking of the prints?</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-1xl  italic tracking-tight text-gray-900\"> Using prints alongside other sources</h3>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    The bpi material might also be used to complement other types of primary sources. Frontispieces might help you study to works of a particular author, for example. Religious imagery might shed a new light on the Reformations. Images here might not be the main thrust of your project but using them alongside other sources will be fruitful. A research project on a political controversy might draw on texts (pamphlets or books), ballads, and printed images - weaving a range of sources together in one analysis will provide a richer and fuller sense of the debate.</p>\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    The question to ask is what visual sources might add to your research project. For example, perhaps your research project considers the history of gender. Visual sources will allow you to think about how masculinity and femininity were understood, represented, and expressed this period. Portraiture is one type of source we can use to study this. How are men and women portrayed? How does this vary by social rank? Were these idealistic depictions and, if so, what might this tell us? Conversely, your project may also consider how gender was used to represent ideas or concepts. How and why were virtues, senses, and emotions depicted in gendered ways? </p>\n\n\n                <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900\">Researching prints</h3>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    Once you have designed your research project and identified the prints you would like to study the next stage is to think about the questions you will ask of your sources. In one sense, images are no different from other types of sources you use as historians, and you should consider the following:</p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">Intention:</span> Why was the image produced? What was the artist trying to do? Why did people want to buy it or look at it? Does the tone of the image (satirical, polemical, memorial, and so on) help us to answer these questions?</li>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">Content:</span> Who and/or what is depicted? Can you unpick the image? </li>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">Audience:</span> Who was the image for? How might it have been viewed?  </li>\n                    <li> - <span class=\"font-bold\">Context:</span> Was the image part of a genre of prints? Did it conform to iconographic conventions? Was it produced at a specific political or cultural moment? Did it relate to other prints or images, and how did they inform it?</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    Each entry in the bpi archive contains bibliographic information that will be important in answering these questions. Compiling information on the who, what, and when of a print may help you to answer the why. As such, establishing when a print was made and by who will be essential groundwork for your research. After that, it will be worth considering if other art historians/historians have written about any of your sources. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"/research\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> and <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"/resources\" target=\"_blank\">resources</a> section of this websites provides a useful list of places to look. </p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900\">Other resources</h3>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    The <a class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\" href=\"/prints\" target=\"_blank\">Prints in Focus</a> section provides examples of how prints might be used as a way into early modern society and culture.

Each charts the development of printmaking in the 17th-century and provides vital iconographic detail, bibliographic information, and references. They are key starting points for all research. Jones' cultural history treats the material by theme. Griffiths focuses on chronology and the role of individual engravers.  O'Connell's book places early modern prints in a broader chronology and provides invaluable references and material. Hunter's collection includes interpretive essays on printed images as they relate to the political, religious, social, cultural, and book histories of the period. In addition to these books, Alastair Fowler's <cite>The Mind of the Book: Pictorial Title-pages</cite> (Oxford, 2017) is an important consideration of the development and purpose of pictorial frontispieces.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    For a consideration of the 18th-century, Timothy Clayton, <cite>The English Print</cite> 1688-1802 (New Haven and London, 1997) provides a good overview. For graphic satire, see Diana Donald's <cite>The Age of Caricature: Satirical Prints in the reign of George III</cite> (New Haven, 1997) and Vic Gatrell's <cite>City of Laughter: Sex and Satire in Eighteenth Century London</cite> (London, 2006).</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"mt-2 text-1xl font-bold italic tracking-tight text-gray-900\"> Politics</h3>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li> - Meredith McNeil Hale, <cite>The Birth of Modern Satire: Romeyn de Hooghe and the Glorious Revolution</cite> (Oxford, 2020).</li>\n                    <li> - Tim Harris, <cite>London Crowds in the reign of Charles II: Propaganda and Politics from the Restoration to the Exclusion Crisis</cite> (Cambridge, 1987). </li>\n                    <li> - Helen Pierce, <cite>Unseemly Pictures: Graphic Satire and Politics in Early Modern England</cite> (New Haven and London, 2008).  </li>\n                    <li> - Kevin Sharpe, <cite>Selling the Tudor Monarchy: Authority and Image in 16th-century England </cite>(New Haven and London, 2009).</li>\n                    <li> - Kevin Sharpe, <cite>Image Wars: Promoting kings and Commonwealths in England</cite>, 1603-60 (New Haven and London, 2010).</li>\n                    <li> - Kevin Sharpe, <cite>Rebranding Rule: The Restoration and Revolution Monarchy</cite> (New Haven and London, 2013).</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    Pierce's study provides close readings of printed images in the period up to the Civil Wars. Harris's book was pioneering in integrating visual sources into a political history of London in the Restoration period. Sharpe's trilogy considers the construction and contesting of power across the 16th and 17th centuries and analyses visual alongside textual and oral sources. Hale's book traces the importance that one artist during the Revolution of 1688/9. </p>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">\n                    For more focussed studies of the role of prints at particular political moments, see: </p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li> - Alastair Bellany, 'Buckingham Engraved: politics, prints images and royal favourites in the 1620s' in <cite>Printed Images in early modern Britain: essays in interpretation</cite> ed.

Her study places carvings, plasterwork, and paintings in domestic spaces in the broader visual culture of early modern England (including printed images). The books by Walsham and Watt use visual sources alongside textual ones - images are used as one way into the history of period. Watt considers the purpose of images on religious ballads, and Walsham shows how early modern understandings of providence and generations (respectively) can be unlocked through the study of visual sources. Aston's book uses one painting as a way into the history of England's Reformation and its history of iconoclasm and conflict. It is a testament of how close readings and case studies can open up broader themes of a period. </p>\n\n                <p class=\"py-4\">The debate about the extent of Protestant hostility to imagery is longstanding.

Tudor and early-Stuart portraits are mainly of royalty and nobility, though the compilation <span class=\"italic\">Herωologia</span> included portraits of leading Englishmen in various walks of life. During the Civil Wars and the Restoration there was a demand for portraits of public figures for which print-sellers like Peter Stent and John Overton catered. The introduction of mezzotint printing at the Restoration was an important development for portraiture, the genre of print for which it was principally used. John Smith was the leading mezzotiner for nearly half a century until his death in 1743.</p>\n            <div class=\"mt-10 text-left\">\n              <p>The variety of portrait prints suggests that they served a range of purposes. Large, single-sheet prints were intended as memorials of the person depicted. It seems likely that these were often hung up on the walls of houses, probably coated with varnish, though by definition those treated in this way have not survived. Smaller plates were often inserted in books or albums. Surviving examples include those of Samuel Pepys, preserved at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and that kept by the Somerset landowner and M.P., Sir Philip Sydenham, held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Books of flowers, birds and animals</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">A popular genre from the early 17th century onwards, these books derived from Dutch exemplars. Many of the earliest examples were copied from originals published by Crispijn de Passe and others, including most of those produced by John Payne, who worked between 1620 and 1640. The books were popular partly for the information about natural phenomena that they conveyed, but also as pattern books for embroidery. Such books took on a new lease of life when the slightly stilted images purveyed by the likes of Payne were replaced by more naturalistic ones in the works produced by Francis Barlow and his successors. The genre survived well into the 18th century.  </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\"> \n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Sets of allegories</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Prints of this type became popular in the mid-17th century. They usually depicted human figures as representations of allegorical subjects like the 12 months, the 4 seasons, the 5 senses, the 7 deadly sins, the 7 liberal arts, or the 12 sybils. The database includes sets of the 4 seasons etched by Hollar (bpi105-08), the 7 deadly sins by John Goddard (bpi256-62), and the 7 liberal arts (bpi652-59) and the 4 senses by Francis Clein (bpi663-68). Anthony Griffiths, <span class=\"italic\">The Print in Stuart Britain</span> (1998), pp. 307-13, provides a list of allegorical series produced in the period. </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>  \n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Genre prints</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">These prints depicted a theme or topic from classical mythology or evoked a mood or milieu. Mid-17th century examples including Richard Gaywood's striking evocation of Democritus and Heraclitus (bpi1099). Mezzotints of a similar type were produced later in the century, for instance one by Isaac Beckett showing Cupid and Psyche, the former lying naked on a bed while the latter looks down on him (bpi1446). Robert Robinson specialised in such mezzotints, evoking classical scenes like 'The ruind Temple of Apollo'. Francis Place's engravings of imaginary landscapes produced are also good examples.</p>  \n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Satirical prints</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"\">Graphic satires could be political or more general. <span class=\"italic\">Dr Panurgus</span>, an elaborate satire on fashionable folly and on the way in which doctors exploited their patients, is typical. Another good example <span class=\"italic\">A New Year's Gift for Shrews</span> (c.1630), in which a nagging wife is chased off by the devil. Satire claimed to be reforming, exposing vice to mockery to cast it out of society.</p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Political satires became prominent from the 1620s onwards, and ideological commentaries on current events were produced during the Civil Wars and after the Succession Crisis (1678-83) and Revolution of 1688, when graphic satire became a mainstay of political debate. <span class=\"italic\">The Double Deliverance</span> (1621), an anti-Catholic satire on James VI/I's attempt to secure a Spanish marriage for Prince Charles that was copied in subsequent satires across the century, is an important example (bpi43). Equally significant are Sir Roger L'Estrange's <span class=\"italic\">The Committee</span> (1680), a searing attack on Whig and Non-conformist Protestants during the Succession Crisis, and the range of satires produced by Romeyn de Hooghe after the Revolution of 1688 (bpi8528-39). </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Playing cards</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Packs of pictorial playing cards are intriguing - they treated serious topics in a playful way. What made them appealing, and what purpose did their often complex imagery serve? A deck of cards showing the maps of English counties dates from c. 1590, and another combining maps and mnemonic devices from c. 1605. Pictorial playing cards really came into vogue in the late-17th century, however. Many were political. Decks depicting the 'Knaveries of the Rump', Popish Plot, and the 1688 Revolution are typical. Others are didactic or recreational, including fortune-telling cards, educational tools, and maps of the countries. </p>  \n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Book illustrations</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Printed images featured prominently in books. They ranged from simple woodblock scenes and diagrams to series of engraved plates. Woodcuts were easier to use for book illustration than engravings because they could be printed in the middle of a typeset page and could be reused far more times. The earliest woodcut illustrations include those in William Caxton's edition of Chaucer's <span class=\"italic\">Canterbury Tales</span> (1483) and woodcuts were used for cheap publications throughout our period. </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Engraved images had to be printed separately on a different press. Despite being more difficult to produce, they became increasingly prevalent. Thomas Geminus pioneered their use in his illustrations to Vesalius (1545). By the 1630s engraved plates were produced for works like Ovid's <span class=\"italic\">Metamorphoses</span>, and in the 1650s and 1660s series of plates were included John Ogilby's editions of Aesop, Homer, and Virgil. Engraved illustrations were also included in scientific books. Robert Hooke's <span class=\"italic\">Micrographia</span> (1665), which shared the findings of the microscope with the English public, is a classic example of their importance. </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Also notable are the antiquarian book illustrations produced by Hollar and others for Sir William Dugdale, in his <span class=\"italic\">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1655) and <span class=\"italic\">History of St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1658). The architectural engravings which appeared in David Loggan's lavish <span class=\"italic\">Oxonia Illustrata</span> (1675), and its sequel <span class=\"italic\"></span>Cantabrigia Illustrata (1690) were equally innovative. Similar works followed in the years around 1700. </p>  \n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Title pages</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Titlepages of books were among the period's most typical printed images. In the 16th-century they were predominantly woodcuts, but from c.1600 they were often engraved plates. Titlepages are often elaborate compositions which sought to encapsulate the theme of a work by emblematic or illustrative means. William Marshall's titlepage to the 1641 edition of Richard Brathwait's <span class=\"italic\">English Gentleman and English Gentlewoman</span> is a good example (bpi1652). A series of emblems showing the attributes of male and female members of the landed class and adding up to a visual exposition of gentility. Other significant examples include the titlepage to John Foxe's <span class=\"italic\">Actes and Monuments</span> (1563), which depicts a central theme of the martyrology, the battle of the Churches of Christ and Antichrist across history, and that of Thomas Hobbes's <span class=\"italic\">Leviathan</span> (1651), which presents the central argument of that work, the need for a sovereign to overcome all other powers in a commonwealth. </p>  \n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"text-center\">\n            <a href=\"#\" @click=\"viewResourcesPage\" @keydown.enter=\"viewResourcesPage()\" class=\"bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 mt-4 mb-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline inline-flex items-center w-40\">Back to Resources </a>\n          </div>\n                   \n      </section>\n\n      <SimpleFooter />\n    </div>\n  </template>\n    \n    <script>\n   \n    import HomeBanner from '../components/HomeBanner.vue';\n    import NavMenu from '../components/NavMenu.vue';\n    import SimpleFooter from '../components/SimpleFooter.vue';\n    import HomeLink from '../components/HomeLink.vue';\n  \n    export default {\n      data() {\n          return {};\n      },\n      components: { \n        HomeLink,\n        HomeBanner, \n        NavMenu,\n        SimpleFooter\n      },\n      methods: {\n        viewResourcesPage() {\n        this.$router.push('/resources')\n        },\n      }\n  }\n    </script>","import { render } from \"./GenresView.vue?vue&type=template&id=62ea5211\"\nimport script from \"./GenresView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./GenresView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","<template>\n    <div class=\"relative container mx-auto px-20 bg-gray-200\">\n      <HomeLink />\n      <HomeBanner />\n      <NavMenu />\n   \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n          <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-2 lg:px-8\">\n            <h1 class=\"mt-2 mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl\">History</h1>\n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">16th Century</h2>\n            <p class=\"mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-left\">The production of printed images in Europe began in the late Middle Ages, slightly predating the introduction of moveable type which revolutionised book production. The technique was first used to produce such items as single-sheet devotional images, and a facsimile of one of these that is in our corpus (bpi1008). Woodcut book illustrations also appeared from an early date. Caxton's edition of Chaucer's <span class=\"italic\">Canterbury Tales</span> (1477) and in books produced by Wynkyn de Worde (d.1534/5) were notable examples. </p>\n            <div class=\"mt-10 text-left\">\n              <p>Important developments occurred in the 1530s and 1540s. Hans Holbein (d.1543) introduced a new genre into England. His illustrative titlepage for the Coverdale Bible (1535) became established the form for titlepages across the 16th and 17th centuries, in which printed images summarised the content or argument of a book in pictorial form. This period also saw the first production of engravings made in metal. Thomas Geminus (1510-62) pioneered this practice in the plates he produced for Vesalius' <span class=\"italic\">De humani corporis fabrica</span>, an anatomical book published in London in 1545. Plates from this book are in the BPI corpus, including a striking image of a flayed man (bpi1038).  </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">\n                In the Elizabethan period book illustrations developed further, largely because of the printshop of John Day. Day's output included several heavily illustrated texts, including Stephen Bateman's <span class=\"italic\">A Christall Glasse of Christian Reformation</span> (1569), William Cunningham's <span class=\"italic\">The cosmographical glasse</span> (1559), Jan van der Noot, <span class=\"italic\">Theatre of Worldlings</span> (1569). The most significant was John Foxe's  <span class=\"italic\">Actes and Monuments</span> (first published in 1563), often called ‘The Book of Martyrs', which used images in an unprecedented scale. This used illustrations on an unprecedented scale and included scenes of martyrdom that became famous in English history. Some of those images are included in the database (bpi5083-5119). Cartographic prints were also developed in this period, most famously in Saxton's <span class=\"italic\">Atlas of England and Wales</span> (1579), and the Armada charts produced by Augustine Ryther were also significant (bpi8978-8989). Portraits were the other principal type of printed image produced in this period.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n          <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-2 lg:px-8\">\n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Early-17th Century</h2>\n            <p class=\"mt-6 text-left\">Most of the artists who made printed images in 16th-century England were foreigners: Holbein, Geminus, and Jodocus Hondius, a Protestant fleeing persecution, being the most prominent. The importance of immigrants to British printmaking continued in the early-17th century, with notable engravers like Francis Delaram and the de Passe family establishing themselves in the reigns of James VI/I and Charles I. There were native-born artists active in this period. William Rogers' portrait of Elizabeth I (1589) was the first print signed by an English engraver (bpi708) and Renold Elstracke (1570-1625) and John Payne (1607-47) made important contributions in the subsequent generation.  </p>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p>There was an upsurge in the woodcut trade in the Jacobean period, and engravings also became increasingly common. These years saw a growing number of specialist dealers in prints, such as the partners Sudbury and Humble, and their rivals, Compton and Henry Holland. These men dealt in prints produced in England, but also commissioned work overseas for the English market, including <span class=\"italic\">Herωologia </span>(1620), a volume of portraits of leading Englishmen. </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">\n                Portraits continued to dominate printmaking. Portraits of the Stuart royal family and members of their courts were popular. Charles I on horseback by Elstrack (1612) is an interesting example(bpi59). The head of the figure was adapted in subsequent versions (1616 and 1625) as the prince's appearance changed. Other genres also flourished at this time. Engraved titlepages became increasingly common, while new genres were introduced, including botanical prints derived from Dutch models, sets of allegorical figures, political prints, and satires of popular vices. Prints offer a glimpse into events and places, such as the engravings of the triumphal arches that lined the streets of the City of London for the Coronation of James I, or the etching of the gardens of Wilton House by their designer, Isaac de Caus (bpi3909-20).\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n          <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8\">\n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Mid-17th Century</h2>\n            <p class=\"mt-4 text-left\">Print production burgeoned in the mid-17th century. Two figures were central to its development: Wenceslaus Hollar and Peter Stent. Hollar (1607-77) entered the service of the Earl of Arundel during the latter's European tour in the 1630s and spent much of the rest of his life in England. Hollar was both talented and prolific. He produced prints in virtually every genre, topography (including the famous Long View of London), maps, portraits, allegories, satires, and natural histories. The BPI does not offer a comprehensive series of Hollar's work, but he is well represented in its corpus. </p>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p>Peter Stent (d.1665) was a print-seller who mass-produced prints from 1642. The outbreak of the Civil War led to an unprecedented demand for topical engravings. Stent produced engravings of subjects linked to the War, including portraits of military figures, maps of battles, and political satires. But as an advertisement he printed in 1654 shows, he also offered prints on a wide variety of subjects: portraits, maps, copy books, and series of prints of flowers and animals. The advertisement (the first to survive for printed images) hints at how buoyant the market for prints had become by the mid-century. Stent employed artists to meet the demand for prints of all kinds, including Hollar and prolific English engravers like Richard Gaywood (1644-80). </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">\n                The 1650s saw other innovative enterprises in printmaking. John Ogilby (1600-76) produced the first of a series of books illustrated with lavish engravings, including editions of Aesop (bpi8121-44) and Virgil. And Sir William Dugdale (1605-86) pioneered the production of engravings of medieval cathedrals, abbeys, and churches to illustrate the first volume of the great <span class=\"italic\">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1655) that he produced with Roger Dodsworth. \n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n          <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8\">\n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Late-17th Century</h2>\n            <p class=\"mt-4 text-left\">The Restoration consolidated the innovations of the revolutionary period. Stent and his successor, John Overton, continued to sell a wide range of prints, as a 1662 advertisement of his wares from 1662 demonstrates. The fact that rival dealers Thomas Jenner and Robert Walton now entered the market showed that demand for prints was growing. Ogilby also continued to thrive in this period, as did another talented engraver of birds and animals, Francis Barlow (1626-1704), who produced lavish sets of natural history scenes. Barlow was one of the most important printmakers of the century. </p>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <p>Demand for engraved portraits also grew rapidly. Engravers like William Faithorne (1616-91) and Robert White (1645-1703) were leading producers. A new technique, the mezzotint, was principally used for portraiture after its introduction in the 1670s and contributed to the availability of and demand for prints. By the 1680s, Isaac Beckett (1653-1719) was the leading mezzotint artist. He was succeeded in this role by John Smith (1652-1742), who produced mezzotint portraits well into the 18th century. Both Beckett and Smith are well represented in the BPI database. </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">\n                New genres also emerged in this period. Scientific books like Robert Hooke's Micrographia (1665) with its detailed engravings of substances and creatures under the microscope, including the highly magnified flea, were notable.  Sets of architectural engravings like David Loggan's Oxonia Illustrata (1675) and its Cambridge equivalent were equally innovative, Marcellus Laroon's Cries of London series (1687) depicted the lives of ordinary people. Political satires became more widespread in this period, particularly after the Popish Plot and Succession Crisis (1678-82) and Revolution of 1688, with prints like Roger L'Estrange's The Committee (1680) demonstrating a growing sophistication in political commentary. In the reign of William and Mary, Dutch satires of British politics circulated, often produced by Romeyn de Hooghe (1645-1708), who is well represented in the database. Graphic satire acquired a potency which anticipated the age of Gillray a century later.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"text-center\">\n            <button type=\"button\" @click=\"viewResourcesPage()\" @keydown.enter=\"viewResourcesPage()\" class=\"bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 mt-4 mb-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-white inline-flex items-center w-40\">Back to Resources \n            </button>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n      <SimpleFooter />\n    </div>\n  </template>\n    \n    <script>\n   \n    import HomeBanner from '../components/HomeBanner.vue';\n    import NavMenu from '../components/NavMenu.vue';\n    import SimpleFooter from '../components/SimpleFooter.vue';\n    import HomeLink from '../components/HomeLink.vue';\n  \n    export default {\n      data() {\n          return {};\n      },\n      components: { \n        HomeLink,\n        HomeBanner, \n        NavMenu,\n        SimpleFooter\n      },\n      methods: {\n        viewResourcesPage() {\n        this.$router.push('/resources')\n        },\n      }\n  }\n    </script>","import { render } from \"./HistoryView.vue?vue&type=template&id=26172b68\"\nimport script from \"./HistoryView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./HistoryView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","<template>\n    <div class=\"relative container mx-auto px-20 bg-gray-200\">\n      <HomeLink />\n      <HomeBanner />\n      <NavMenu />\n   \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n          <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8\">\n            <h1 class=\"mt-2 mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl\">Techniques</h1>\n           \n            <span class=\"float-right pl-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_engravingetching.jpg\" ></span>\n            <p class=\"py-4 text-left\">Printing is the transferral of ink from a prepared surface (block, plate, or stone) onto paper or other material.

Woodblocks were used in Europe from the 13th century, with the first prints on paper appearing in the late-14th. </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Blocks were made from soft wood around an inch thick. The design would be drawn on it (or on paper glued to the surface). A woodcutter would cut away the areas around the lines of the design before applying ink to the remaining raised area using a dabber. The image was transferred to paper by stamping it by hand, by rubbing the back of paper laid on top of the block, or, from the 1450s onwards, by use of a press. Because the presses were also used for movable type, it was possible to print images and letterpress text together on a single page of a book. This was not possible in the intaglio processes. Despite this advantage, woodcuts declined in the 17th century relative to intaglio prints that could produce finer and more precise images. </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Distinguishing a woodcut from one of the other techniques is straightforward. A woodcut will lack a platemark (the mark around the edges of intaglio prints); lines are more likely to be uneven when compared to intaglio prints; and by it is possible to see that lines have been achieved by cutting around them.</p>\n              <span class=\"float-right pl-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_turnerplate.jpg\" ></span>\n          \n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\"> \n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Engraving</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 text-left\">\n              <span class=\"float-left pr-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_engravingtools.jpg\" ></span>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Engraved prints date from the 15th century. Engraving involved cutting a design into a copper plate using a burin, a small steel rod with a sharpened V-shaped point. The completed design consisted of a series of incised lines on the copper plate.  </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">After warming the plate, ink was applied and worked into the lines. Ink on the plate's surface area was then carefully wiped off and the plate was then placed face up in an intaglio press. A sheet of dampened paper was placed on top of it and cloths placed on top of both to even out the pressure when the plate passed through the press's rollers. The pressure of the rollers forced the paper into the plate's grooves, dragging out the ink. The paper was then hung up to dry and the plate re-inked for a further impression. The pressure of the press caused the platemark, the indented line where the edge of the plate was pushed into the paper.   </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Engravings can be distinguished from woodcuts by inspecting the ink, which is usually slightly raised on the paper because of the paper dragging the ink up when passed through the press. Engravings can be identified by the steadiness of the lines, and the fine points at the beginning of lines as the burin is first pushed into the plate and at the end as it is lifted from the plate. </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>  \n      </section> \n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Etching</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <span class=\"float-right pr-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_pouringaquafortis.jpg\" ></span> \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Etched prints date from the early 16th century. Etching involved cutting lines into a copper print using acid (rather than a burin, as in engraving). The entire plate was covered evenly with a melted acid-resistant wax ground. After this had cooled and hardened, the etcher used a needle to draw lines through the ground and expose the copper underneath (this was a less laborious than engraving directly into copper). The plate was then immersed in acid which ate into those parts of the plate exposed by the etched lines (which became deeper the longer the plate was immersed). The ground was then removed, and impressions were made from the plate using an intaglio press in the same way as engravings. </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Etchings can be distinguished from engravings by the relative unevenness of their lines caused by the acid not biting evenly. Engraved lines are more formal than etched lines, which often resemble the greater freedom of drawing.</p> \n             \n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Mezzotint</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <span class=\"float-left pr-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_greatexecutioner.jpg\" ></span>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Mezzotints date from the mid-17th century. The technique is credited to a German soldier, Ludwig von Siegen, in 1642. The first mezzotints were produced by Prince Rupert in the 1650s. The technique was widely known by the 1660s. </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Unlike engraving and etching, in mezzotint the engraver worked from dark to light. First a rocker (a blade with teeth) was used to roughen the plate. A plate inked in this rough state it would print a rich black. The engraver created the design by smoothing out parts of the plate with a scraper/burnisher. The smoother the area, the less ink it held, and tones could be created: light burnishing of an area printed dark grey, heavy scraping light grey. Inking the plate was a complex task. The printing process that followed was the same as for engravings/etchings. Because they were highly worked mezzotint plates became worn by press more quickly than engravings or etchings, and it was not uncommon for the printmaker to rework the plate during the printing process. </p>\n              <p class=\"py-4\">Mezzotints are distinguishable from the other engravings, etching, and woodcuts because of their absence of lines and their tonal quality. The different techniques in the intaglio process could be combined on a single plate: mezzotints often had areas of engraved detail, and many engravers first etched background detail onto a plate before continuing to engrave the design.</p>  \n            </div>\n          </div>     \n      </section>\n      <section class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6\">\n        <div class=\"mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8\">     \n            <h2 class=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left\">Printing, states and impressions</h2>\n            <div class=\"mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left\">\n              <span class=\"float-right pr-6\"><img src=\"@/assets/thm_bosseprinting.jpg\" ></span> \n              <p class=\"py-4\">The printing matrix (block/plate) could be re-used numerous times, either to create more impressions, or, after reworking, different states.  </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Blocks or plates had almost limitless states. These were the result of some alteration, whether minor reworking or significant re-engraving: indeed, an entire metal plate could be smoothed down and re-used for a completely different image. Woodblocks were more durable than metal plates. Repeated printings eventually wore down copper plates which printmakers had to rework during the process to maintain the image's quality. This applied particularly to mezzotints. A different state of a print often resulted from this reworking of the plate. </p>  \n              <p class=\"py-4\">Proofs were another common example of a different state. Several proofs could be made before the final published state was reached, each a way of checking the progress of the design. The most common proofs are prints before lettering was added. Lettering was often added to a print by a specialist lettering engraver and could be extensive, including mottos, scriptural references, a title, explanatory verses, and details of a print's designer (or the artist after whom the design was taken), engraver, and publisher. Latin terms identified the different roles:  </p>  \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"text-left indent-4 pt-8 t\">\n              <ul>\n              <li><span

Said by George Vertue to have come from Lincolnshire and to have been apprenticed to the portrait painter, William Shepherd, Barlow was responsible for various large oil paintings of birds and animals which survive at Clandon Park, Surrey, and at Ham House. He was also a noted designer and etcher, producing high quality illustrations for Edward Benlowes' Theophila (1652) and for an edition of Aesop's Fables which he published himself in 1666. He also designed sets of prints of birds and animals which were etched by Wenceslaus Hollar, Richard Gaywood and others. During and after the Popish Plot, he produced propaganda prints on behalf of the Whigs, including sets of playing cards. According to Vertue, Barlow was poor when he died in 1704.\n                </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\">\n        <span class=\"text-2xl\">Beckett, Isaac</span>\n        <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n            <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n        </svg>\n        </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <div class=\"p-5 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n            <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                (c. 1653-88) The first great mezzotint engraver of the English school. Said by George Vertue to have learned the technique from Edward Luttrell while apprenticed to a calico printer, Beckett's earliest known mezzotints date from c. 1681. Initially, his prints were published by Edward Cooper and Alexander Browne, but by 1686 he had set up his own business. His signed mezzotints are mostly portraits, particularly after paintings by Willem Wissing and Godfrey Kneller, though he also published landscapes and genre subjects. He died in 1688, leaving the field open to his pupil, John Smith, who took over his relationship with Kneller and much of his stock.\n            </p>\n    \n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Blooteling, Abraham der </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n            <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n                <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n\n                    <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                        (1614-?66) Van der Borcht was the son of a man of the same name who had fled from the Netherlands to Germany, where he was trained partly by his father and partly by Matthaüs Merian, through whom he probably met Hollar.

Clein was born at Rostock on the Baltic and worked for Christian IV of Denmark before coming to England in 1623, where he was patronised first by James I and then by Charles I. Clein's most significant activity was as designer of the tapestries produced at Mortlake, and he also executed decorations for various country houses, including Ham House. When the Civil War forced Charles I to discontinue his subsidy to the Mortlake factory, Clein instead turned to printmaking, and most of his designs date from between 1645 and his death, including various sets of prints with mythological subjects and illustrations for John Ogilby's Fables of Aesop Paraphrased (1651) and his editions of Virgil and Homer.\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>  \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-8\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-8\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Cockson, Thomas </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-8\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-8\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (active c. 1591-1636) Cockson was the most prolific producer of portrait prints in Tudor England, whose activity continued well into the 17th century.

He was a specialist in the engraving of shorthand, of which he invented a system of his own, and he also engraved plates of scripts, including those for Josiah Ricraft's Peculiar Characters of the Oriental Languages (?1645). The fact that the title page to William Evats' translation of Grotius' Of the Rights of Peace and War (London, Ralph Smith, 1682) is signed ‘T.

Delaram was probably of foreign origin, but it is unclear where he trained. His output included portraits and title-pages, and he was also responsible for some of the earliest books of flowers, beasts and birds to be produced in this country and the earliest English drawing book, although no copy of the latter survives.\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>     \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-13\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-13\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-13\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Delff, Willem Jacobsz. </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-13\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-13\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (1580-1638) Delff, who spent his entire life at Delft, was the son of a portrait painter, an occupation also followed by two brothers.

Quite likely a Catholic, there is no evidence he ever returned to England.\n                </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\">\n        <span class=\"text-2xl\">Dunstall, John</span>\n        <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n            <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n        </svg>\n        </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <div class=\"p-5 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n            <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                (d. 1693) Probably a native of Chichester, where his father of the same name was a stationer, Dunstall was employed by Peter Stent in the years around 1660 and thereafter set himself up as a drawing master, producing many plates to illustrate a treatise on ‘The Art of Delineation' which was never published and survives in the British Library.\n            </p>\n    \n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Elder, William </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n            <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n                <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n\n                    <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                        (fl. 1680-1701) Originally from Scotland, Elder worked in London principally as an engraver of portraits, usually after older engravings, for booksellers.

While serving in the royalist army he was taken prisoner at the siege of Basing House in 1645, and, after being taken to London, he subsequently commuted his imprisonment for banishment, going to Paris where he worked for several years. By 1652 he had returned to England where he set up a successful business which he continued for the rest of his life, though increasingly his activity was as a dealer rather than an engraver. At his best, Faithorne could produce very sensitive engraved portraits; however, he was increasingly overshadowed by younger artists from the 1660s onwards. In 1662, he published an English translation of Abraham Bosse's treatise on engraving.\n\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>  \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-7\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-7\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Faithorne, William, the Younger  </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-7\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-7\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (c. 1670-1703), son of the preceding, was apprenticed to his father in 1683 and is known only as an engraver of mezzotints.

His best known work is his Compendios totius Anatomie Delineatio (1545), which was plagiarised from the work of Vesalius.

His prints include engravings after Old Master drawings; he was also responsible for the illustrations to the second edition of Shaftesbury's Characteristicks (1714). He collaborated with one printseller, his fellow Frenchman Paul van Somer, on two plates of Protestant significance: the Seven Bishops of 1688, and a portrait of the Duke of Schomberg, killed at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 (the latter they published jointly).\n                </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\">\n        <span class=\"text-2xl\">Griffier, Jan</span>\n        <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n            <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n        </svg>\n        </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-2\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-2\">\n        <div class=\"p-5 border border-b-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n            <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                (1645-1718) Griffier was trained as a painter in Amsterdam. He became known in London from the late 1660s onwards for his landscapes, particularly of the Thames. In 1695 he returned to the Netherlands but was back in London a decade later. In addition to paintings, Griffier produced mezzotints and etchings, the latter mainly of animals and birds after Francis Barlow.\nHertochs, Abraham (fl. 1626-1672) An engraver of Dutch extraction who produced various engraved title-pages, portraits and other book illustrations, including the frontispiece to Evelyn's Sculptura (1662).\n            </p>\n    \n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Elder, William </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n            <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-3\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-3\">\n                <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n\n                    <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                        (fl. 1680-1701) Originally from Scotland, Elder worked in London principally as an engraver of portraits, usually after older engravings, for booksellers.

After working for Matthaüs Merian in Frankfurt, under whom his skills as a topographical artist were developed, his career was transformed when he was taken into the service of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, in 1636. He travelled to England with Howard, becoming a member of his household and executing various etchings for him. However, in 1644 he was forced into exile in Antwerp, where he remained for several years (though many of the works that he executed were for the English market). He returned to England in 1652 and thereafter was involved in a variety of publishing projects, not least those initiated by Sir William Dugdale and John Ogilby. He also produced various remarkable views and maps of London and Windsor, while in the 1670s he produced a set of views of the English colony at Tangier.\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>  \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-6\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-6\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Hondius, Jodocus </span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-6\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-6\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (1563-1612/13) Hondius hailed from Ghent, but as a Protestant he took refuge in England in about 1583-4, where he continued to practice the skills as an engraver that he had initially developed in Flanders; he also devoted himself to the construction of geographical globes and scientific instruments.

No work is known by the eldest, and his son is usually called 'Old Laroon' to differentiate him from his son (1679-1772), whose activity fell mainly in the 18th century. After a period when he worked in York, 'Old Laroon' moved to London in the 1670s, his address being 4 Bow Street, Covent Garden. He is best known for his drawings of The Cryes of London, which were engraved by John Savage (active 1683-1700) and published by Pierce Tempest in 1688, though he was also notable for his slightly risqué genre scenes in mezzotint..\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>     \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-14\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-14\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-14\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Lens, Bernard, II</span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-14\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-14\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (1659-1725) The Lens family were artists of Dutch origin, and three successive members were named Bernard, namely the father (1659-108), who we learn from George Vertue was an enamel painter (and also wrote religious tracts), his son (1659-1725), who specialised in mezzotints and was appointed drawing master at Christ's Hospital in 1705, and his son (1682-1740), a topographical draughtsman, miniaturist and drawing master who was limner to George I and II. This has led to some confusion between the output of Bernard Lens II and Bernard Lens III, though a large corpus of mezzotints of various sizes, especially of genre subjects, can definitely be attributed to Bernard Lens II.\n                </p>  \n            </div>\n        </div>   \n        <h2 id=\"accordion-collapse-heading-15\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3\" data-accordion-target=\"#accordion-collapse-body-15\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"accordion-collapse-body-15\">\n            <span class=\"text-2xl\">Lodge, William</span>\n            <svg data-accordion-icon class=\"w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\">\n                <path stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"M9 5 5 1 1 5\"/>\n            </svg>\n            </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div id=\"accordion-collapse-body-15\" class=\"hidden\" aria-labelledby=\"accordion-collapse-heading-15\">\n            <div class=\"p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left\">\n                <p class=\"mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left\">\n                    (1649-89) Lodge hailed from a family of wealthy cloth merchants from Leeds and was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, and Lincoln's Inn.

In the 1660s he moved to Oxford where he was appointed 'public sculptor' and was responsible for producing Oxonia Illustrata (1675). He returned to London in 1675, producing a companion volume on Cambridge over the next decade and a half.

Hind to an 'Anonymous Engraver, c.1600-10',<sup>i</sup> and surviving only in a later impression in the British Museum and the Houghton Library, Harvard, with the address of the late seventeenth-century publisher, John Garrett. Recently Antony Griffiths firmly attributed it to the engraver Renold Elstrack, born c.1570 and last heard of in 1625. He further noted that the printseller Thomas Jenner was advertising it as part of his stock in 1662 as <span class=\"italic\">The Ridinge of the Asse</span>, and that it must have passed, on his death eleven years later, to Garrett (as did most of the rest of Jenner's stock). As Griffiths cogently remarks, 'That only two impressions survive of a print that remained in production for so long is entirely typical of early British printmaking'.<sup>ii</sup> Elstrack is also known as the engraver of at least one other broadside satire, the traditional misogynist <span class=\"italic\">Bulchin and Thingut</span>.<sup>iii</sup></p>\n        \n        <p class=\"py-2\">Perhaps not altogether surprisingly, given what little we know of Elstrack's family origins, his engraving derives quite closely from an early sixteenth-century German woodcut of which an impression survives in the Douce print collection at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, though not the speeches given to the various representatives of society who struggle to ride the ass. <sup>iv</sup>Evidently a fairly well-known motif in Germany, it is found, for example, on one of the biscuit-moulds (dated 1517) belonging to Claus Stalburg the Rich, Mayor of Frankfurt, who catalogued it thus: <span class=\"italic\">Der 16. stain ist das eselryten, und will eyn iglicher der allernest seyn</span> [The 16th stone (biscuit-mould) is Riding the Ass, and everyone wants to be the very next].<sup>v</sup></p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">\n        In graphic art it reappears roughly a century later in Peter Rollos' print-book aimed at the <span class=\"italic\">alba amicorum</span> student market, the <span class=\"italic\">Philotheca Corneliana</span> (Berlin, 1619), the plate itself being pasted onto f.101v. of the album of Hans Ludwig Pfinzing von Henfenfelden [ Bamberg, SBB, Msc. Hist, 176]. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">\n        The German woodcut print is untitled, but the full title of Elstrack's version - <span class=\"italic\">Whilst maskinge in their follies all doe passe/ Though all say nay yet all doe ride the asse -</span> probably accurately reflects the intention of the original composition, i.e. it is a general, rather than a particular, satire, in which, with the exception of the judge (<span class=\"italic\">Mr Justice</span> - though the verse explains that his motives for declining to ride are selfish), all social ranks and types of early Jacobean society (including the prostitute <span class=\"italic\">Dame Punke, Don Pandar, Don Gull and a Gallant</span>) are associated with asinine folly (cf. the similar message of <span class=\"italic\">Doctor Panurgus</span>, which will be discussed next month). All 'ride the ass', that is, everyone is foolish, though they even squabble about this. With this usage, compare the title-page woodcut to <span class=\"italic\">The Fool's Complaint to Gotham College</span> (1643) depicting a fool riding on an ass which says, <span class=\"italic\">The fool rides me</span>. Though seemingly unrecorded elsewhere, Robert Burton appears to use the idiom in precisely the same sense and context in his vastly learned <span class=\"italic\">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1621): that they may go <span class=\"italic\">'ride the ass'</span>, and all sail along in the <span class=\"italic\">'ship of fools'</span>.<sup>vi</sup> Burton shows an awareness of pictorial prints throughout his book, referring earlier in passing to the fact that <span class=\"italic\">all the world is mad... it is (which Epicthonius Cosmopolites expressed not many years since in a map) made like a fool's head (with that motto, Caput helleboro dignum).</span><sup>vii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">A late seventeenth - or perhaps early eighteenth - century engraver revived and revised Elstrack's composition to illustrate another sheet entitled, <span class=\"italic\">The ass age, or the world in hieroglyphick. An amusement, agreeably resembling the humour of the present times.</span> Interestingly an earlier state, which must have been pirated, is suggested by the words <span class=\"italic\">Beware of paultry wooden-cutts</span>  after the imprint, and, indeed, a woodcut-illustrated version survives in the Folger Shakespeare Library, entitled <span class=\"italic\">The ass age: or, the fools in fashion: being a comical description of the times</span>, dated 1712. </p> \n\n      \n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">A.M.

As a print, it was popular throughout Europe, from as early as c.1500 in Germany,<sup>i</sup> but the earliest known English example to survive was issued some time after c.1665, “<span class=\"italic\">qrinted</span> [sic] and <span class=\"italic\">Sould by John Overton</span>”, though it does not appear in any of Overton's published catalogues; it is preserved uniquely in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. A very closely-related version, but without any imprint, is held in the Library of Congress collection.</p>\n        \n      <p class=\"py-2\">Without attempting a comprehensive listing, subsequent eighteenth-century versions include the 'wood royal' <span class=\"italic\">Cat's Castle, besieged and stormed by the Rats</span> recorded in Marshall and Dicey's '1764' catalogue;<sup>ii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">Cats castle besieged by the rats</span> issued by John Marshall c.1790 (Bodleian); another of c.1790 by Bowles & Carver, and a version closely related to this, bearing the imprint of G (?) Ash of Fetter Lane, London (British Museum), and yet another example issued by G. Sheppard in the Lewis-Walpole Library, Farmington, Connecticut. </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">The present Overton sheet dramatically presents the feline fortress centre-stage, with flags flying from its turrets, a bell tower and a cupola with a rat being hanged from a protruding mast. In it stands <span class=\"italic\">Maister Tybet [sic] prince of Cat[s]</span>, who proclaims: </p> \n      \n      <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n      My command is to you all<br>\n      To kill the Rats both great & smal\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">continuing:</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n      <span class=\"italic\">Downe with the Rouges</span> [sic] <span class=\"italic\">defend me now or never<br>\n      If they get up we are undon for ever.</span>\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\"> However, the castle is the subject of a formidable assault by its rodent adversaries, with ladders set up against its walls, cannons on every side and several phalanxes of attackers advancing, including a group approaching from the bottom left in a boat with the legend: </p>\n      \n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n      <span class=\"italic\">Fight ou</span> [sic] <span class=\"italic\">brave Rats and kill our mortall foes<br>\n      We'll fight it out nor Will we feare thair blowes</span>\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">while in the centre a cannon is being fired to cries of:</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n      <span class=\"italic\">Your commistion</span> [sic] <span class=\"italic\">is to kill and destroy<br>\n      Mischevous Cats that doe your state annoy.</span>\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">Above this is a gallows where a rat is hanging a cat with the legend: <span class=\"italic\">up you goe Mistriss puse</span>, and another cat is having a noose put round her neck. Below are two scenes which appear inset in rectangular frames (though, in fact, only one may properly be so called — close inspection shows that it is the pole of the banner which forms the apparent lefthand margin of the scenes). These apparently inset scenes perhaps adumbrate the comic-strip presentation of later versions; the 'upper scene' shows two rats reading the letter of commission with its pendent seals, while the 'lower' one, showing a band of eight rats armed with halberds and spears held aloft, is captioned,</p>\n      \n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n      <span class=\"italic\">if wee these catcs</span> [sic] <span class=\"italic\">can overcom and kill<br>\n      of cheese and Bacon we shall have our fill.</span>\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">This literary humour is reflected in details of the image — the rats' banners displaying cheeses and hams, while the flags flown from the cats' castle bear fish (three fish in the earliest-known German woodcut of c.1500, and also in the late seventeenth-century English version where they appear above the legend <span class=\"italic\">Herrings for ever</span>, while the ensign which flutters from the stern of <span class=\"italic\">The Royal Rat</span> depicts two rats either side of a large circular cheese over the motto, <span class=\"italic\">Cheshire Cheese for ever</span>).</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">The names of the two battle-leaders on the present sheet perhaps suggest derivation from some French version (<span class=\"italic\">Tybert</span>—spelled correctly in the Library of Congress impression—and <span class=\"italic\">Nigro Musell</span>, perhaps Black Snout, the latter element from Old French <span class=\"italic\">musel</span>, snout), and yet in an early seventeenth-century French version of <span class=\"italic\">La grande & merueilleuse Bataille, d'entre les Chats, & les Rats</span>, which bears the imprint <span class=\"italic\">A Lyon pour Leonard Odet; au coin de rue Ferrandiere</span>, 1610, the prince des Chatz is named <span class=\"italic\">Mitou</span>, while in a later seventeenth-century version, closer in composition to the present example, issued by Pierre Bertrand in Paris and entitled <span class=\"italic\">Le Fort des Chatz assiege par les Ratz</span>, he is named <span class=\"italic\">Raminagrobis </span>(probably the source of the name of La Fontaine's feline hero). It is curious that it is the English sheet rather than the French one which uses the name <span class=\"italic\">Tibert</span> for the cats' leader. Deriving from the name given to the cat in the medieval French beast-epic, the <span class=\"italic\">Roman de Renart</span>, it was certainly familiar to the Elizabethans and lies behind Mercutio's punning reference to <span class=\"italic\">Tybalt</span> as <span class=\"italic\">King of Cats in Romeo & Juliet</span> (III.i.76), and Nashe's contemporary reference to <span class=\"italic\">Tibault...Prince of Cats</span> in <span class=\"italic\">Have with you to Saffron Walden</span> (1596). By the time of the late eighteenth-century English sheets, the protagonists are the less colourfully-named <span class=\"italic\">King Mew</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Prince Squeak</span>.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">Though all European versions of the print bear a close generic resemblance, telltale details in the English version suggest it derives immediately (in reverse) from a Dutch model.<sup>iii</sup>  </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">The originators of the prints have left the siege in the balance—from the images it is not possible to guess the outcome—but the lengthy verse text accompanying the Lyon version, at least, makes it clear that the cats, who are explicitly said to represent great villains <span class=\"italic\">[gros larrons]</span>, successfully defend the castle and the few surviving rats, representing the lesser villains <span class=\"italic\"></span> are forced to flee. The earliest known version similarly leaves the outcome of the siege undecided, but we are given some orientation as to how to read this provocative image from the couplet</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n      <span class=\"italic\">disi figur get alle di an<br>\n      dy iren obristen under sta[n]</span><br>\n      This image refers to all those <br>\n      ho are subject to their superiors</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">Though even this in its ambiguity—tautology, indeed!—gets us no further, though German commentators have noted the popular peasant movements in late fifteenth-century Germany associated with such names as the <span class=\"italic\">Bundschuh</span>, and a little later, <span class=\"italic\">Armer Konrad</span>. At the time our present print was issued, the tragic upheaval of the English Civil War was still fresh in the memory, and it is quite possible that an earlier (lost) version—or, just possibly, the very version without imprint in the Library of Congress—had been issued in the 1630s or 1640s. But while there is some reason to believe that the rats storming the cats' castle was sometimes capable of a political interpretation, it seems that for the majority of viewers most of the time it was a purely humorous image.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">The Bowles & Carter version, London, c.1790, has verse captions as follows:</p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n      As the Cats had been long the Rats' foes<br>\n      The latter resolv'd to oppose<br>\n      So by Land and by Sea in a throng<br>\n      They scratch and they quarrel ding dong<br>\n      And over their foes to prevail<br>\n      Some fire and some the Walls scale<br>\n      Yet how it will end we can't say<br>\n      But see the fight out and you may.<br>\n      King Mew his commission bestows<br>\n      to murder all Rats as his foes.<br>\n      Prince Squeak gives his orders with joy<br>\n      All Enemy Cats to destroy.<br>\n      A Squadron of rats sally out<br>\n      to put all the Cats to the rout.<br>\n      The Pussies when taken are banged<br>\n      Drawn quarter'd beheaded & hang'd. \n      </p>\n\n      <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n      <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n        <li class=\"py-2\">For the anterior history of the motif, found in wall-painting from the twelfth century, see Malcolm Jones,  <cite>The Secret Middle Ages  </cite>(Stroud, 2002), p. 148.  </li>\n        <li class=\"py-2\">available at <a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.diceyandmarshall.bham.ac.uk/refframe.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.diceyandmarshall.bham.ac.uk/refframe.htm</a></li>\n        <li class=\"py-2\">A sixteenth-century two-block woodcut print, of which the right-hand half only survives in an eighteenth-century impression, reproduced in E.H. van Heurck and G.J.

She is holding her dress up at the front and his gaze is fixed on her (presumably) exposed crotch.</p>\n        \n      <p class=\"py-2\">The accompanying caption reads, </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n      What Drudgery's here, what Bridewell-like Correction!<br>\n      To bring an Old Man, to an Insurrection.<br>\n      Firk<sup>i</sup> on Fair Lady [,] Flaug the Fumblers Thighs [,]<br>\n      Without such Conjuring th' Devil will not rise\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">It is signed <span class=\"italic\">MLauron pinx</span>, i.e. 'M[arcellus] Laroon painted' (the canvas which this print copies). Laroon died in 1702 and is best known for the drawings of Metropolitan tradesmen and women that John Savage engraved for Pierce Tempest's 1688 edition of <span class=\"italic\">The Cryes of London</span>. As well as paintings and etchings, he is known to have produced at least five mezzotints in the early 1680s.<sup>ii</sup>  It is possible that he engraved the present print himself, or it might have been engraved by John Smith (who engraved others after paintings by Laroon), who may also have been the publisher. </p> \n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">Laroon was best-known in his own time—as now—for his Dutch-style genre scenes of 'low life', a fact that led to a disapproving assessment of his work by the appropriately-named Vertue: 'His thoughts in his pictures shew him to be a Man of levity, of loose conversation & morals suteable to his birth & education, being low & spurious.'<sup>iii</sup> But it is time we addressed ourselves to the subject of this print. Quite what is going on exactly, in this apparently uniquely surviving impression of a late seventeenth-century English mezzotint? Is it intentionally pornographic? I feel certain it is, but also that it is not without a hint of satire. And what of the title and caption—<span class=\"italic\">The Cully Flaug'd</span> and <span class=\"italic\">…Flaug the Fumblers Thighs?</span>\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n        There is no doubt that 'flaug' is merely a phonetic variant of 'flog', as we now spell the word in Standard English, but, surprisingly, at the date this print was produced, the verb was still very new to the language—OED's first citation is from Coles's <span class=\"italic\">English Dictionary</span> (1676)<sup>iv</sup>  where it is defined as to whip, but marked as a cant word. Published in 1680, Tell-Troth's <span class=\"italic\">Knavery of Astrology</span> claims that 'of late years there's a neat <span class=\"italic\">Invention</span>, called <span class=\"italic\">Flogging</span>, invented on purpose to pleasure <span class=\"italic\">Old Fumblers</span>.'\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"py-2\">\n          The caption - far from being the hackwork such labels are often considered—is a masterpiece of condensed wit. Consider the word <span class=\"italic\">Insurrection</span> alone—the artist shows us a world in which a youngish woman, hardly more than a girl, can beat an elderly man, as if a reversal of the schoolmaster birching the naughty pupil: this is the revolution of the World Turned Upside Down—albeit at his sexual prompting—and given the suggestive import of the final line of the caption it is impossible not to hear <span class=\"italic\">erection</span> in the word too.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">\n          Significantly, the elderly man in our print is also termed a <span class=\"italic\">Fumbler</span>, defined in B.E's <span class=\"italic\">New Dictionary of the Canting Crew</span> (1699) as 'an unperforming Husband, one that is insufficient', echoing the alternative title of <span class=\"italic\">The Contented Cuckold</span> ballad (1686), 'the fortunate fumbler… he being insufficient to perform'. In the 1678 edition of Ray's <span class=\"italic\">A Collection of English Proverbs</span> the expression, 'He is free of Fumbler's Hall', is glossed, 'Spoken of a man that cannot get his wife with child'. The <span class=\"italic\">fumbler</span>, then, is certainly an infertile man, and often an impotent one too. The caption to our print with its innuendo couched in terms of conjuring up the Devil clearly suggests that the elderly man is unable to achieve an erection without being thrashed in this manner.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">\n          OED's citation at 'flauging'—curiously given a separate entry in the Dictionary—and its unnecessarily cautious definition, ? = 'flogging', has at least the merit of being highly apposite to our print: it is from the opening scene of D'Urfey's <span class=\"italic\">Injured Princess</span> (1682): 'Ask him if he knows where we may find a sound Wench: he's a flauging old Whipster, I warrant him' (with 'whipster' being defined as 'one addicted to whipping or flogging'). Of even greater assistance to us here, however, is Gordon Williams' <span class=\"italic\">Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature</span> (London, 1994) which gives a separate entry to 'flogging cully', where it is defined as a 'whore's client who desires whipping', a term first found in Head's <span class=\"italic\">Canting Academy </span>(1673), and it is from Williams that I take most of my remaining examples. B.E.'s definition of 'flogging' in his <span class=\"italic\">New Dictionary of the Canting Crew</span> (1699) reads, 'a Naked Woman's whipping (with Rods) an Old (usually)… Lecher.' In London Spy II (1698) Ned Ward describes an 'Old Leacher' as being 'one of that <span class=\"italic\">Classis</span> in the <span class=\"italic\">Black-School</span> of <span class=\"italic\">Sodomy</span>, who are call'd… <span class=\"italic\">Flogging Cullies</span>. This <span class=\"italic\">Unnatural Beast</span> gives Money to…<span class=\"italic\">Strumpets</span>… and they down with his Breeches and Scourge his Privities till they have laid his <span class=\"italic\">Leachery</span>.'\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">Though Ward described this penchant for flagellation as a 'new Vice', it had, in fact, already been described in an epigram, <span class=\"italic\">In Francum</span>, published a century earlier in the late 1590s by Sir John Davies:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n        When Francus comes to sollace with his whoore<br>\n        He sends for rods and strips himselfe stark naked:<br>\n        For his lust sleepes, and will not rise before,<br>\n        By whipping of the wench it be awaked.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">And what of the scene of this little drama? It hardly seems correct to call it a 'domestic interior'; it is much too sparsely furnished for that: perhaps it is rather a room in what contemporaries referred to as a 'flogging school', i.e. a brothel specialising in flagellation. In his <span class=\"italic\">London Terrae Filius</span> (1707) Ned Ward describes a whore 'who shall handle a <span class=\"italic\">Birch-Rod</span> with e'er a Pedagogue in <span class=\"italic\">Christendom…</span> Mistress of a <span class=\"italic\"></span>Flogging-School, where a parcel of Old <span class=\"italic\">Fanatical Goats</span> go to be Whip'd into their Leachery.'</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">The elderly gentleman's hat lies on the table beside a jug of wine and glass and—surely significant—a couple of coins. He is presumably paying for this particular specialist service, confirming that we are in a brothel chamber. But is the hat of any particular type that allows us to identify his profession? Is he a clergyman, for example? A schoolmaster? One can almost see the tabloid headlines! </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">This impression appears to be a unique survivor and such subject-matter is always prey to later censorship by destruction, however popular in its own time, as late seventeenth-century auction catalogues from which I take the following lot descriptions would seems to suggest [Wing nos. in brackets]: an <span class=\"italic\">old Cully flog'd by Larroon</span> (13th Jan 1692, lot 161) [C7662], and a <span class=\"italic\">Flogging-piece after Laroon</span> (15th Sept 1690, lot 187) [C5130], and, though unattributed, <span class=\"italic\">The Cully well flogged</span> (30th April 1690, lot 707) [C5126], and a <span class=\"italic\">Woman flogging a Cully </span>(Easter 1691, lot 63) [G1750].</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">If we can agree to label this print by that contentious term 'pornographic', then it is one of the earliest such to survive from England. Inasmuch as the post-Restoration era enjoyed an apparently greater freedom when it came to publishing 'literary' erotica, it appears to have enjoyed a somewhat more relaxed attitude to visual erotica too—and yet, and yet… Given the peculiar vulnerability of this category of art—visual as well as literary—we should exercise the greatest caution when attempting to assess the range and availability, quantity and quality of early modern 'erotic' art.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">In <span class=\"italic\">Histriomastix</span> (1633) one of the many evils the Puritan William Prynne inveighed against were 'obscene pictures'— not to mention, lascivious songs, bonfires, grand Christmases, long hair and laughter.<sup>v</sup>  Puritans like Prynne had time (and censorship) on their side; in the sense in which we understand the term in the early twenty-first century, it is arguable that only one other example of visual pornography of native manufacture from this period has survived (see below).</p>  \n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">Throughout the period with which we are concerned, there would seem to have been relatively little 'homegrown' material, so—as until relatively recent times—those interested in acquiring images of a pornographic nature turned naturally to the Continent. In Vanbrugh's <span class=\"italic\">The Country Wife</span> (first staged in 1675), having just returned from France, Horner significantly claims, 'I have brought over not so much as a Bawdy Picture, new Postures nor the second part of the Escholle des Filles'.<sup>vi</sup>  In the very same year a group of Oxford undergraduates was discovered clandestinely trying to run off copies of these same <span class=\"italic\">Postures</span> on the Clarendon Press at night.<sup>vii</sup>  The six <span class=\"italic\">French Postures</span> advertised for sale in Jenner's 1662 list are intriguing but their appearance unknown, and perhaps quite innocent—unlike the <span class=\"italic\">10 Drawings of several postures</span> offered at the sale of John Dunstall's library in 1693.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">As for Horner's <span class=\"italic\">Escholle des Filles</span>, originally published in Paris in 1655 (and unillustrated), it was read in the original by Samuel Pepys in 1668 and then burnt, 'that it might not be among my books to my shame'. The illustrated English translation, published anonymously as <span class=\"italic\">The School of Venus</span> in 1680, survives uniquely in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Opposite the title-page is an etched frontispiece entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Schoole of Venus</span> which depicts a modestly-dressed woman standing behind a booth selling dildoes, while two potential buyers appear to be discussing the relative merits of those on offer and a third woman (a maid?) makes as if to tear her hair out in horror!<sup>viii</sup>  Even more extraordinary is the survival of no fewer than twelve mezzotint illustrations accompanying the two Dialogues of <span class=\"italic\">The School of Venus</span>, the crudity of which tends to confirm an English publication for the edition,<sup>ix</sup> but which also constitute surely the closest we shall ever come to an early modern English version of Aretine's <span class=\"italic\">Postures</span>. </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">OED sense 4: 'To beat, whip, lash, trounce, drub', citing <cite>British Apollo</cite> No. 9. 3/1 (1708), <cite>Who Bound up a tingling Rod, and firk'd his Tail</cite>, and Ainsworth's <cite>Latin Dictionary</cite> (1736) in which <span class=\"italic\">To firk</span> is glossed <span class=\"italic\">flagello</span>. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">A.

Here representatives of the various denominations of the earlier Commonwealth era—a naked Adamite, a Ranter, a Quaker, an Anabaptist, a Presbyterian, an Independent, [Lodowick] <span class=\"italic\">Mugleton</span> himself, and [James] <span class=\"italic\">Nailor</span>—are depicted as constituting a committee listening to petitions from a dog, a horse, a man and a woman. In the lefthand corner, the various victims of the Civil War appear in chains, while in the righthand corner, a Church of England parson is forced to vomit forth his living—a detail which may well owe something to <a href=\"\">Doctor Panurgus</a>, which Sir Roger L'Estrange, who conceived the design for the present print and penned its text, had accorded his <span class=\"italic\">imprimatur</span> eight years earlier.<sup>ii</sup>  At this period, L'Estrange was the most effective of the Tory propagandists, and the message of the print as a whole is to imply that the present day Puritan faction is plotting to seize Parliament and subvert the Government, which will lead to a second Civil War. When criticised for his part in the design, however, L'Estrange declared that the print was <span class=\"italic\">a piece historical and only recommended by way of caution</span>.<sup>iii</sup>  The subtitle alludes to the present era of Popish Plot(s) and the verses describe how such misinformation is to be  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n        …the Pulpits, and the Presses<br>\n        Must ring of Popery, Grievances, Addresses,<br>\n        Plots of all Sorts, Invasions, Massacres,<br> \n        Troops under Ground, Plague-Plaisters, Cavaliers…\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Committee; or Popery in Masquerade</span> is extremely detailed visually, and also accompanied by 178 lines of verse commentary; it would require an essay-length commentary to do it justice.<sup>iv</sup>  Instead, I shall concentrate here on the petitioners or 'sectaries' themselves, whose alleged infamous behaviour is clearly intended to discredit all such schismatics.</p> \n        <p class=\"py-2\">The petitioners before the Committee are, in fact, two animal/human couples: a dog named <span class=\"italic\">Swash</span> and the <span class=\"italic\">Elders Mayd</span>; and a horse and man, jointly labelled <span class=\"italic\">The Colchester Wedding</span>. The verse to which the latter figures are keyed makes it clear that the man is a Quaker and the horse a mare, and it is clear that bestiality is implied</p>\n        <p class=\"py-2\">\n          In a remarkable and amusing burlesque sermon, <span class=\"italic\">The Exaltation of Christmas Pye</span> (1659), by one P.C. - allegedly <span class=\"italic\">Dr. of Divinity and Midwifery</span> - as the parodic preacher is exemplifying the various types of <span class=\"italic\">conjunction copulative</span>, he cannot resist referring, in passing, to what are evidently these same two pairs:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n        your praeternatural Conjunction Copulative, as when an Elders maid lyes<br>\n        with a Mastiff or as when a Quaker buggereth a Mare.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">The former alleged act is the subject of Sir John Birkenhead's <span class=\"italic\">The four-legg'd elder, or, A horrible relation of a dog and an elders maid to the tune of The lady's fall</span> (1647), reprinted three years before the present print. The elder is a Presbyterian - so his mastiff (which is, indeed, named Swash here) is counted one too - and his maid, Jane, was apparently born in Colchester.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">Twelve years later Birkenhead was also the author of <span class=\"italic\">The Four'legg'd Quaker To the Tune of the Dog and Elder's Maid, Or, the Lady's Fall </span>(1659), which concerns another Colchester resident, one Ralph Green, and an act that appears to have occurred six years earlier. This broadside is also illustrated with four individual woodcuts: a man with tongue out, advancing towards a horse, a centaur wearing a hat and holding a sword in one hand and the hilt only of another in the other hand, and a devil also wearing a hat advancing towards the latter holding a bridle.<sup>v</sup>  But Sir John could not help referring readers to his earlier composition in the accompanying verse text:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2 italic\">\n        But though 'twas foul 'tween Swash and Jane,<br>\n        Yet this is ten times worse,<br>\n        For then a Dog did play the Man,<br>\n        But Man now play'd the Horse.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">The same year Sir John Denham too was moved to publish an unillustrated broadside, <span class=\"italic\">A relation of a Quaker that to the Shame of his Profession Attempted to Bugger a Mare near Colchester </span>(1659).<sup>vi</sup>\n         </p>\n        <p class=\"py-2\"> \n          <span class=\"italic\">The Committee</span> evidently achieved sufficient notoriety to make it worthwhile for some anonymous publisher to issue a somewhat inferior copy: this is BM Satires 1081. \n        </p>\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Antony Griffiths, <cite>The Print in Stuart Britain</cite> (London, 1998), p. 287. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">It is pleasing to be able to add a sixth item to the list of five — all licensed to John Overton on 28th October 1672 — given by Antony Griffiths (op. cit., p. 148), viz. a second impression of <cite>The Common Weales Canker Worms</cite> (Globe knew only of the earlier Stent impression in the Sutherland Collection), in what I produce evidence to show in my forthcoming book is its third state. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">L'Estrange, <cite>Answer to a whole Litter of Libels </cite>(1680), cited in F.G.

This impression is also exceptional in bearing the manuscript licence of Sir Roger L'Estrange dated October 28th 1672, presumably when being licensed to Stent's successor, John Overton, and one of six sheets now known to have been licensed by L'Estrange on that day. Why Stent (active c.1642-1665) and his successor Overton should wish to reissue it in the different political circumstances obtaining in the mid and later century is not obvious, though there is perhaps no need to look for any particular reason behind the publication of an anti-Catholic sheet in post-Reformation England. Despite its topical origins in the particular historical milieu of the late Jacobean era, as an estates satire which lampoons various occupations its appeal is perennial—and its graphic impact also makes it an attractive publishing venture.</p>\n        \n        <p class=\"py-2\">Generically, it is an example of the topos I term <span class=\"italic\">Death and the Four/Five Alls</span> of which various examples are known,<sup>ii</sup> but it introduces a decidedly more satirical note. It is a complex composition. Arranged in a circle round a grotesque female devil standing in a hell-mouth, ten human types (each provided with an inscribed banderole and an inset emblem) describe their relations with the previous persons. Each character performs his (usually negative) office for all the preceding characters, while the Devil reveals that ultimately they are all his agents, and that he will use the chain composed of human fingers, ears and tongues that links them, to drag them all into hell. Each of the ten types is further labelled with a letter which is keyed to the corresponding quatrain below the image portion of the sheet.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">Globe suggested the sheet was engraved 'c. 1650' because he evidently associated the <span class=\"italic\">Common Weal</span> of the title with the <span class=\"italic\">Commonwealth</span> era, i.e. the 'Republican' period between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660—<span class=\"italic\">even Homer nods</span>! As we have noted above, the print was clearly still in circulation at this period, but I suggest it was first issued a generation earlier. Certainly the costumes are <span class=\"italic\">mpossible</span>i for the 1650s, but there is no detail that would be out of place in the 1620s. The costume historian, Prof. Ribiera, has kindly informed me that she would date the costume c.1625, that of the tailor being—appropriately—in the latest datable fashion on the sheet.</p> \n        \n        <p class=\"py-2\">There are further clues to be had in the accompanying text—which allots a quatrain to each character—and in their accompanying 'emblems'. Although the ten characters represented are for the most part 'generic', I suggest that those I here refer to as the Jesuit, labelled G, and the Ambassador, labelled I, were intended by the designer to be identified with two known individuals, notorious in Jacobean England. The verse given to the Ambassador clearly implies Spain's imperial ambitions, and that the figure in question is working cunningly ('foxe-like') for Spain—again, quite inappropriate to the international <span class=\"italic\">Realpolitik</span> of c.1650, but precisely relevant to that of the 1620s: I find I cannot resist the suggestion that the man who boasts of deceiving the previous ten is none other than the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar. Gondomar was the target both of Middleton's satirical play <span class=\"italic\">A Game at Chess</span> (1625), and of Scott's <span class=\"italic\">The Second Part of Vox Populi, or Gondomar appearing in the likenes of Matchiavell</span> (1624), where he appears on the engraved title-page.</p>\n       \n        <p class=\"py-2\"> The inset 'emblems' are certainly worthy of consideration in their own right—and apparently unknown to emblem-scholars. Though the published emblem-book had only been available to an English readership for some forty years at the time I suggest this print was issued—since Whitney's selection of 1586, followed up by translations of Paradin (1591), La Perrière (1606,1614) and Peacham's <span class=\"italic\">Minerva Brittana</span> (1612)—recent scholarship has supplied ample evidence of the familiarity of English writers with the emblem genre already in Elizabethan times.<sup>iii</sup> Each emblem here consists of an image in a rectangular frame and a Latin motto, transcribed below. The 'seducing' Jesuit (?) holds a book and rosary, but his civilian disguise is visible beneath the otherwise all-enveloping cloak and cowl, his verses openly proclaim his intention to 'bring in Popery… By cunning plotts, devised for Romish use', and significantly, his emblem shows a man setting light to a trail of gunpowder which leads to what looks like a castle—surely an allusion to the Gunpowder Plot, especially when combined with the other Catholic monk, the confessor who absolves all the others. I find I cannot resist identifying him as the Jesuit, Stephen Garnet, the Gunpowder Plotters' confessor. </p>\n     \n        <p class=\"py-2\">Extraordinarily - references to specific artworks being rare in this era -- two texts published in London in the early 1620s refer to our motif, one of them in great detail. On October 26 1623 at <span class=\"italic\">Pauls Crosse</span> Thomas Adams preached a sermon entitled <span class=\"italic\">The barren tree</span>, at the end of which he alludes to what he calls our <span class=\"italic\">satyre</span> thus:</p>\n      \n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">It was a smart Inuention of him, that hauing placed the Emperour, and the Pope, reconciled, in their Maiestick Thrones, he brought the States </span>[i.e. estates] <span class=\"italic\">of the world before them. First comes a Counseller of State, with this Motto</span>, I aduise you two: <span class=\"italic\">then a Courtier</span>, I Flatter you three: <span class=\"italic\">then a Husbandman</span>, I feed you foure: <span class=\"italic\">then a Merchant</span>, I Coussen you fiue: <span class=\"italic\">then a Lawyer</span>, I Robbe you sixe: <span class=\"italic\">then a Souldier</span>, I Fight for you seuen: <span class=\"italic\">then a Physician</span>, I Kill you eight: <span class=\"italic\">Lastly, a Priest</span>, I Absolue you all nine. (p.55).</p>\n       \n        <p class=\"py-2\">James Mabbe's translation of Aleman's <span class=\"italic\">The Rogue or the life of Guzman de Alfarache</span> was first published in 1622 and was made partly from the original Spanish edition, and partly from an Italian translation by Barezzi.<sup>iv</sup> On p.251 of the Second Part, a marginal note signals <span class=\"italic\">A merry tale deliuered in the Pulpit by a Preacher</span>. The <span class=\"italic\">tale</span> in question does not appear in the Spanish original - and as yet I have been unable to see the <span class=\"italic\">Vita del picaro Gusmano d'Alfarace</span> (Venice, 1615) - but if it is Mabbe's addition, it seems the preacher he was referring to cannot have been Adams, and in fact his account is much more detailed, and offers striking similarities with <span class=\"italic\">The Common Weales Canker Wormes</span>: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">\"Hearken to that, which was deliuered vnto me by a famous Preacher, who discoursing vpon this subiect of rich men, amongst many other things, I remember he told vs at that time of a certaine picture, the vpper and middle part of which square, or peece, was taken vp by a great rich man, which was there portrayed forth to the life: On his right hand, stood a roaring boy, to fight for him, if need were; and on his left, a foole, to make his Worship merry, and to put him out of his dumps: both which were expressed in such a posture, as fitted best with them. Vnder this rich man, was drawne a country Clowne; vnder the Clowne, a Merchant; vnder the Merchant, a Counsellor at Law; vnder the Counsellor, a Confessor; vnder the Confessor, a Physitian; and vnder the Physitian, the Deuill, with a long chaine, whose linkes were made of womens tongues, which kept a horrible ratling. And he farther added, that the rich man had written ouer his head</span>; These two I keepe:   [i.e. <span class=\"italic\">roaring boy & foole</span>]</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Clownes word was</span>; I maintaine these three:  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Merchants motto</span>; I rob these foure: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Counsellor[at Law]s posie</span>; I pill these fiue: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Confessors</span>; I absolue these six: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Physitians</span>; I kill these seuen: :</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\"><span class=\"italic\">And the Deuill had a labell comming out of his mouth, which said</span>; I carry away all these eight with me to Hell.\"</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">It will be seen how very closely this agrees with our print, the principal difference being that Mabbe enumerates only eight estates, where the print has twelve.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">The <span class=\"italic\">inuention</span> as described by Adams was subsequently plagiarised wholesale, appearing almost verbatim in books by Grove (1651), Gove (1652), Spencer (1658), Hibbert (1662), Winstanley (1680), and Brown (1690) - though Gove did at least have the grace to give his source.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"py-2\">For fuller detail about all the other characters depicted and their associations see my essay in <span class=\"italic\">Printed Images in Early Modern Britain: Essays in Interpretation</span> (Burlington, 2010), edited by Michael Hunter, which I hope sufficiently illustrates the anti-Jesuit fervour abroad in the 1620s to provide a convincingly appropriate context for my redating of <span class=\"italic\">The Common Weals Canker Wormes</span> to c.1625, alongside the two identifications I have suggested here.</p>\n\n        <p

But as the young man, prey to multifarious follies and devoted to fashionable fads and fancies, has long been the target of the moralists' especial wrath, and the <span class=\"italic\">saeva indignatio</span> of the satirists, the follies of dissolute youth are what I take to be the principal subject of this puzzling sheet which, as Griffiths notes, 'has a complicated ancestry'.<sup>i</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The costume of the figures would seem to date to the 1620s, and this agrees with the known dates of activity of the engraver, Martin Droeshout, who has signed the sheet with his monogram: <span class=\"italic\">MD sculpsit</span>. The earliest state of the present print to survive, however, was probably issued in the 1650s, bearing Peter Stent's imprint alone, and is held in the Wellcome Institute collection.<sup>ii</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The composition derives from a print engraved by Matthaus Greuter, probably c.1600 (itself deriving from one of the emblems in the de Brys' hugely influential <span class=\"italic\">Emblemata Saecularia</span> of 1596), which was issued in French/German and German-only editions, the former bearing the title <span class=\"italic\">Le medecin guarissant Phantasie Purgeant aussi Par drogues la folie</span> [The doctor curing fantasies, and also purging folly with drugs]. But Droeshout made significant changes to his model, dropping the doctor's assistant, adding a richly-dressed couple, an inset panel in which two pluralists confront each other weighed down by the churches on their shoulders, and a great deal of explanatory text in the form of labels within the image-frame.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Naming the wonder-working doctor <span class=\"italic\">Panurgus</span> seems to have been Droeshout's innovation. Why? It is unlikely Droeshout had read Rabelais - most English intellectuals knew only the French author's name, which they used, like those of Aretino and Machiavelli, merely as a hate-word. <span class=\"italic\">Panourgia</span> is a medical term, and Galen uses it for 'adulterated or false drugs', and although the etymological sense of the name is neutrally 'all-work', later English usage similarly tended to interpret the term pejoratively as 'ready to do any work', i.e. including illegal things, as a criminal would be. Notwithstanding this, however, there is no doubt that in our print Dr. Panurgus is a <span class=\"italic\">positive</span> figure, able to cure his patients, who come from all ranks of society - as the verses and the figures themselves make clear - of their manifold follies. Significantly, for dating purposes, the Latinate form of the name - which by itself suggests independence of Rabelais' creation - is known to have been used by two English writers in 1619 and 1623 only, and perhaps strengthens the case for an origin in the 1620s.<sup>iii</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">From the copious inscription text I excerpt a few salient points.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Though concentrating on the foibles and follies of the gallant, who is by definition youthful, the verse makes clear that the <span class=\"italic\">Millions</span> who resort to the Doctor come from <span class=\"italic\">Cuntry, Citty & the Court</span> - i.e. that folly is no respecter of a person's rank or origins. By his Waters <span class=\"italic\">Drugges ,Conserves & Potions</span>, the Doctor <span class=\"italic\"></span>purgeth fancies follies, idle motions, many of which are detailed in the verses below the image, but also visualised in the phantasmagoria that escapes from the <span class=\"italic\">Gallants Fornace</span>. The Doctor is currently pouring a dose labelled <span class=\"italic\"></span>Wisdome and Understanding down the throat of a <span class=\"italic\">rude Rustical</span>l who sits on a close-stool and through whom <span class=\"italic\">passe</span> various animals and birds, including an ass, which is being milked by a man (in the German original only three little fools are excreted). The Doctor informs us that taking the <span class=\"italic\">Gallants Braine</span> out and washing it had proved ineffective, but now, subliming his head in the furnace has yielded <span class=\"italic\">good Successe</span> - in the form of the <span class=\"italic\">Strange Chimaera-Crotchetts</span> visible in the smoke above. They are later referred to as both <span class=\"italic\">Projects and ayrie Castles</span> - i.e. 'castles in the air', cf. from Burton's contemporary <span class=\"italic\">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1621): <span class=\"italic\">That castle in the ayr, that crochet, that whimsie</span><sup>iv</sup>  - and include cards, dice, backgammon-board, tobacco-pipes, violin, tennis, masks, feathers, plumed hat, swords, a dressed ape, a woman with a fan, a man teaching a horse to perform tricks, a bear-baiting, a boy flying a kite, a man with wings strapped to his shoulders (attempt at human flight? No Elizabethan/Jacobean candidate known to me, though doubtless they existed - for a while...), a man sliding down a rope from the tower of (Old) St. Paul's (a popular contemporary feat), jug and goblet, limed branch for bird-catching, a man walking a pair of hounds, and a fencer (with wings). Most of these are copied from the German original - the interest for us lies chiefly in those which were not, and which we may thus reasonably consider peculiarly English: they include the bear-baiting, the tobacco-pipes,<sup>v</sup>   the St. Paul's rope-slider and the horse being taught tricks - perhaps intended to be William Banks and his celebrated horse 'Marocco'. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">To the well-dressed lady with her fan and pet squirrel on a lead the Doctor says,</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Once (faire) I knew the tongues Phlebotomie<br>\n        Had powre to Cure your Sexes Maladie<br>\n        But now youre manly humors boile so highe<br>\n        That you must in the Gallants Fornace lye\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">which looks like a swipe at both the garrulity traditionally attributed to women, as well - interestingly - as evidencing a more contemporary Jacobean concern with manly women, as reflected for instance in the pamphlet, <span class=\"italic\">Hic Mulier: or, The Man-Woman: Being a medicine to cure the Coltish Disease of the Staggers in the Masculine-Feminines of our Times </span>(1620). The verses claim she has even more <span class=\"italic\">wandring Crotchets</span> than the gallant and lists them:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Steelettoes<sup>vi</sup> girdles patches painted brests<sup>vii</sup><br>\n        Points<sup>viii</sup> powders feathers washes<sup>ix</sup>  & the rest<br>\n        ... Haire breath Complexions all are borrowed ware.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The similarly well-dressed gentleman the Doctor addresses mockingly as <span class=\"italic\">Sir Briske, spruce master Cittyzsinne</span>, in which the last, clearly eccentric spelling is presumably to point up a pun, as if he embodies the <span class=\"italic\">City's sin</span>.<sup>x</sup>  Though, like his lady, he looks more like a courtier than a tradesman - which has led to much complicated historical speculation, principally that the pair are the Countess of Essex and her lover the Earl of Somerset - the contemporary label identifies one of the ingredients of the potion the Doctor will administer as <span class=\"italic\">plaine dealing</span>, and one of the things it will expel as <span class=\"italic\">couzening weights</span>. But perhaps it is precisely part of this upstart citizen's presumption that, though a mere tradesman, he apes the dress of the gentry. In the probably contemporary sheet, <span class=\"italic\">The Common Weales Canker Worms or the Locusts both of Church, and States</span>, the Merchant similarly says, <span class=\"italic\">I cosen these foure</span> [i.e the four preceding characters] and his inset emblem is a pair of scales and a yardstick with the motto, <span class=\"italic\">libris et labris lucror furtiuis</span> [I gain by fraudulent scales and measures], while in the verse beneath the engraving, he says, <span class=\"italic\">Ile ease your purses with a trick of skill/While mine with waights & measures false I fill</span>.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Inset into our engraving is a panel - seemingly not a later addition - depicting two divines confronting each other, both with churches on their backs which cause them to stoop, and one of whom carries a second church in his arms. It is tempting to suggest that the square frame in which these pluralists are depicted, and which appears to interrupt the composition, is a post-Droeshout interpolation, perhaps c.1642, when the motif was current (and which is also the earliest known date of Peter Stent's activity as a print-publisher).<sup>xi</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It is captioned</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Who bore two Churches & complaind of none<br>\n        Nowe being purged findes too much of one.  \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">If this pluralists panel is original, however, we can certainly point to the existence of the iconographic motif this early, for it features prominently in <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/14`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">The Mappe of the Man of Sinne</router-link>issued in 1622. Indeed, it might provide a useful dating indication for the <span class=\"italic\">Panurgus</span> print, as the <span class=\"italic\">Nowe</span> of the caption perhaps suggests some topical ecclesiastical legislation.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">There may well be a 'quotation' from <span class=\"italic\"></span>Doctor Panurgus in a print issued some fifty years later entitled <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/3`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">The Committee; or Popery in Masquerade </router-link> (1680). This holds up the various nonconformist sects for ridicule, including the Quakers; they are depicted as constituting a committee listening to petitions from a dog, a horse, a man and a woman. To the left, the various victims of the Civil War appear in chains, while on the right, a Church of England priest is forced to vomit forth his living - a detail which may well owe something to the fact that its designer, Sir Roger L'Estrange, the most effective of the Tory propagandists at this period, was also the Restoration censor, and in that capacity had personally accorded <span class=\"italic\">Doctor Panurgus</span> his imprimatur eight years earlier; indeed, the present impression (one of only three known) is signed and dated by him, <span class=\"italic\">Licensed October 28 1692, Ro.

It is a superb large sheet entitled, <span class=\"italic\">The Embleme of Englands Distractions As also of her attained, and further expected Freedome, & Happiness Per H M 1658</span>. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Oliver stands holding a sword piercing three crowns upraised in one hand, an open book in the other, and tramples with one foot between the bare breasts of the prostrate Whore of Babylon, who pours the contents of her 'cup of abominations' over a hydra-headed serpent labelled <span class=\"italic\">Error</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Faction</span>, which his other foot pins to the ground. Above his head are the dove bearing the olive branch of peace (which also puns on his name), and a glory, indicating divine approval. He stands, himself a pillar of the State, like a latter-day Hercules between two columns, on one of which allegorical figures representing England, Ireland and Scotland offer him laurel wreaths, while the other is composed of the fundamentals of English civil society, Magna Carta, the Rule of Law, etc. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Three Old Testament vignettes are placed above him: Noah's ark safely arriving through wind and wave (here steering a middle course between rocks anachronistically but Classically identified as Scylla and Charybdis!) to the top of Ararat on which the sun beams down', an example of the popular metaphor of the Ship of State:<sup>i</sup>   Oliver has steered the Ship safely through the trials and tribulations (of Civil War), till it has now come to rest in the sunny uplands of divine favour. Somewhat more puzzling, however,' even sinister' is the third scene, the Sacrifice of Isaac, with Jacob his sword poised about to decapitate the boy - surely this cannot allude to the beheading of Charles I some nine years earlier? The summit on which the terrible deed is about to be done is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Moria</span> - unless this Greek name (famously and punningly used by Sir Thomas More in his <span class=\"italic\">Encomium Moriae</span> or Praise of Folly) was instead intended not as a place-name, but as an allusion to the folly of such an act?</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The bottom of the sheet is filled with several emblematic scenes of peace and prosperity (left), and machinations against the state (right). A shepherd pipes to his sheep beneath another punning olive tree, labelled <span class=\"italic\">Oliva Pacis</span> ['the olive of peace', but also, 'Oliver's peace'], and the Isaian prophecy, <span class=\"italic\">They shall beat their Speares into Pruneing-hooks And their Swords into Plow-shears</span>, is illustrated by the peaceful occupations of cutting grape-bunches from an unconvincing, tree-like vine with a pruning-hook, and a man using a horse-drawn plough. Perhaps most interesting, however, is the last of these peaceful emblems, the war-helmet which has become used as a hive by bees; already 150 years old by this date, it first appears in England in Geoffrey Whitney's <span class=\"italic\">A Choice of Emblemes</span> (1586), but there derives from Andrea Alciati's original emblem-book of 1531. Closer in date to Faithorne's print of Cromwell, it had also appeared in George Wither's <span class=\"italic\">Collection of Emblemes</span> (1635). </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In the bottom righthand corner of the sheet two bonneted Jesuits are depicted, one carrying a dark lantern, a man with bellows trying to set light to barrels of gunpowder, and Samson's trick of a pair of foxes yoked by the tails about to fire a cornfield', some of which imagery recurs a few years later in another print entitled <span class=\"italic\">Pyrotechnica Loyalana, Ignatian fireworks</span> (1667). A gallows with noose is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Proditorum finis funis</span> [The rope is the end of traitors]. The gunpowder is placed within a cavern of the rock on which the righthand pillar featuring the representations of England, Scotland and Ireland stands, and is also attacked by a number of men (one with a dog's head) wielding pickaxes' literal attempts to undermine the state, presumably. The final scene which remains mysterious to me, is of three rustics, one with pitchfork, approaching a small copse at the foot of the same rock.<sup>ii</sup>   </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Ironically, in the fifth state of the plate (1690), the head was changed to that of William of Orange, while the head of Queen Mary tops the lefthand pillar. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">For an authoritative discussion of the various states of this engraving, see Antony Griffiths, <span class=\"italic\">The Print in Stuart Britain</span>, 1603-89 (London, 1998), cat. no. 115.

The outside of the lid of the so-called Armada or Heneage jewel made some time in the second half of the 1580s, for example,  depicts the ark of the English Church on a stormy sea surrounded by the inscription 'SAEVAS TRANQUILLA PER UNDAS' ('calm through the savage waves') in allusion to Elizabeth's safeguarding of the church, and it was a device also used by James I on medals.<sup>i</sup>   </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In the present sheet, <span class=\"italic\">Englands Miraculous Preservation Emblematically Described, Erected for a perpetuall Monument to Posterity</span> (1647), the state of England following the Civil War is symbolised by a storm-tossed ship, 'preserv'd and almost safe at land'. The ship, 'Englands Ark', is divided into three separate compartments labelled, 'House of Lords', 'House of Commons', and 'Asembly' (i.e. the Westminster Assembly set up to reform the English church along Presbyterian lines in 1643). Inset in six medallions are named Parliamentary generals, while drowning in the sea, powerless to impede the ship's safe passage, are Royalists and their sympathisers, including Charles and his Queen (perhaps intended to be siren-like), a square-capped Archbishop Laud (?), Prince Rupert who slashes in vain at the ship with his sword, and Strafford who fires a gun at it. It is accompanied by a long poem by the otherwise little-known John Lecester. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A slightly later state with no letterpress, and now entitled <span class=\"italic\">Englands Arke Secured and the Eninyes [sic] to the Parliment and Kingdom Overwhelmed</span>, bearing the imprint of Robert Walton, notes that 'These boystrous waves do represent Malignant foes to land & Parliment', and identifies all the drowning royalists by name; the bishop is now identified as 'Greenvill' and the book he holds up as the Book of Common Prayer, while the siren-like woman is labelled 'L[ady] Aubigny', and the document with pendent seal that she holds, inscribed 'Com: of Aray', i.e. a Commission of Array, empowering her to levy troops on the King's behalf. She is also shown holding the same Commission, bearing the King's seal 'brought from Oxford', in the first frame of a multi-frame print entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Malignants Trecherous and Bloody Plot against the Parliament</span> (1643).</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A similar maritime metaphor using the emblematic image of a ship appears in one of the earliest known prints to have been issued by Robert Walton—Thomason dated his copy 17 February 1648—entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Invisible Weapon, or Truth's Triumph over Errors</span>. The text of this itemises no fewer than thirty-nine such errors and refutes them with quotations from Scripture, the very 'Biblia Sacra' which the Church herself, seated under a canopy amidships, holds aloft, a palm in her other hand. The Church's bark is assailed by a motley collection of tyrants, heresiarchs and sectaries—from a mainstream Protestant point of view, of course—i.e. Nero and Domitian, Arius, the Pope, a Turk, a Shaker, an Arminian, a Socinian, a Familist, an Adamite, a Jesuit, a 'Papist' waving a dark lantern, clearly intended for Guy Fawkes, and a literally two-faced 'Antiscripturist' who brandishes a serpent.<sup>ii</sup> Griffiths believes it to have been executed by the same unidentified engraver who cut <span class=\"italic\">Englands Miraculous Preservation Emblematically Described</span>, noting a variation of that sheet also bearing Walton's imprint and dated by Thomason 21 September 1646,<sup>iii</sup>  and indeed, there seem to be textual links between the two sheets too, the latter ending somewhat inconsequentially with 'An Apostrophe to the Church' which includes the lines, 'Outward enmity shal not hurt a jot, / If thine intestine Errors hurt thee not.' </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In similar vein, when Robert White came to engrave a frontispiece for the second volume of <span class=\"italic\">Nalson's An impartial collection of the great affairs of state</span> (1689), he too had recourse to the image of a storm-tossed ship to symbolise the state of England in 1649. While a thunderbolt from heaven strikes St. Stephen's, Westminster Palace, i.e. the Parliamentary chapel, as a symbolic sign of the divine displeasure, and while citizens fight in the foreground, with an army mustered ominously behind them, sailors throw Charles I, Jonah-like, into the water from a ship, significantly identified in 'The Meaning of the Frontispiece', as 'th' Royal Sovereign'.  </p>\n\n        \n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">See A.G.

All-in-New-Fashions</span>, survives uniquely in the print-collection of Francis Douce (1757-1834) in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It depicts a mock-funeral procession and is a fairly straightforward satire of extravagant male fashion issued c.1630. The imprint on the sheet reads, <span class=\"italic\">Are to be Sould by Thomas Geele at the Dagger in Lumbard Street</span>. Little is known about the print-seller Thomas Geele,<sup>i</sup>  but as F.P. Wilson was the first to point out, he is known to have sold from the same address a suite of prints engraved by Robert Vaughan of the <span class=\"italic\">Twelve Months of the Year</span> illustrated by couples in national dress, which now survive uniquely as bound into the Huntington Library copy of Breton's <span class=\"italic\">Fantasticks</span> which was published in 1626. In 1630, still at the same address, his name appears on the second reprint of the <span class=\"italic\">Baziliώlogia</span>, first issued in 1618, which contains over 30 prints of English monarchs. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The satire may be simple enough, but the print is not quite what it seems, for it is an extremely close copy (in reverse) of <span class=\"italic\">Trauer-Gesang/ Vber den all zu früe tödtlichen abgang/ Alla Modo Monsier</span> [Song of Mourning on the all too early deathly departure of <span class=\"italic\">A la Mode Monsieur]</span>, or else (in the same direction) of <span class=\"italic\">Vnuersehner Hochbetriebter Doch Lächerlicher Todfall</span>… [Unexpected … yet ridiculous death …], both dated 1629, the former explicitly on April Fools' Day.<sup>ii</sup>  It is also entirely typical that no fewer than six impressions of the former sheet survive in German repositories, whereas the English print survives uniquely in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Harms assumes that the gallant's <span class=\"italic\">Junckfraw, who ligt 6 woche[n]n zu bett</span> [literally, 'lies 6 weeks in bed'], must be lying in <span class=\"italic\">Wochenbett</span>, i.e. childbed, and thus will eventually be delivered of an infant who will continue his father's fashion-victimhood. Be that as it may, the translator clearly understood her bedbound condition differently, Englishing it, <span class=\"italic\">His wench 6 weekes through Greife doth keepe Her Bedd</span>.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A long procession of mourners issues from beneath the upper room in which the grieving wench keeps her bed. Though dressed identically, and sporting the same pointed beard, the last few to emerge are labelled: <span class=\"italic\">His Launderesses and their maydes</span>; <span class=\"italic\">Spurrier</span> [maker of spurs]; <span class=\"italic\">Fendsor</span>  [i.e. fencer = fencing instructor]; <span class=\"italic\">Cutler; Musissioner</span> [musician]; <span class=\"italic\">Taylor;Taylor; Gouldsmith</span>; clearly making a point, though not quite as heavy-handedly as the German original, in which no fewer than a dozen mourners are identified as tailors, in fact, every other mourner of those named. There are other—perhaps telling—minor differences in the tradesmen the English engraver has chosen to include or omit: if we can accept that his <span class=\"italic\">Haberdasher</span> renders the German <span class=\"italic\">Kramer</span>, it is interesting that he has translated the general <span class=\"italic\">Kauffman as Wine Merchant</span>. But he has omitted five other tradesmen altogether: the <span class=\"italic\">Dantzmeister</span> [dancing-instructor], <span class=\"italic\">Bereitter</span> [riding-instructor], <span class=\"italic\">Schwertfeger </span>[sword-maker], but also—more interesting from our point of view—the <span class=\"italic\">Drucker</span> [printer] and <span class=\"italic\">Kupferstecher</span> [engraver]. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The German original is but one of a rash of prints appearing in 1629 satirising the adoption of French costume by fashionable German males. The French fashions being satirised may be seen, for example, in Abraham Bosse's <span class=\"italic\">Le Jardin de la Noblesse Française</span> issued in Paris in 1629, a suite of 18 fashion-plates depicting French cavaliers dressed in the height of fashion. Antony Griffiths has shown how John Goddard curiously selected seven of this set to copy and issued them—perhaps in the later 1630s—as <span class=\"italic\">The Seaven deadly Sins</span>.<sup>iii</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The verses below our English funeral-procession claim—somewhat vaguely—that his <span class=\"italic\">Long Coate, Capeles Cloake, Ruffes</span>, [and] <span class=\"italic\">fallinge Bands</span> are <span class=\"italic\">all fashions Lately brought from foreyne Lands</span>. But the image itself may serve as something of a cautionary tale for us—if we did not know its origin, it would be very tempting to use it as an illustration of English male fashion c.1630 and, indeed, too often historians have used such images irresponsibly, knowing nothing of their origins.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">For an unequivocally native English satire of male fashion we must wait until the engraved <span class=\"italic\">Picture of an English antick, with a list of his ridiculous habits, and apish gestures</span> issued in 1646, in which the fashionable Cavalier beau is accompanied by a caption which enumerates no fewer than twenty-six details of his attire and accoutrements.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">The Funeral Obseques of Sir All-in-New-Fashions</span> is not the only mock-funeral to appear as a print. When <span class=\"italic\"></span>'The Twelve Years Truce' between Spain and the Netherlands failed in 1621, the breakdown was satirised in a sheet entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Funerall of the Netherlands Peace</span> (1621), printed in the Netherlands from the plate etched by Claes Jansz. Visscher for the original Dutch version, <span class=\"italic\">Testament van't Bestand, Treves Endt,</span> but with English letterpress verses added. Thus the Dutch title Treves Endt—which cannot have been immediately meaningful to the English viewer—still actually heads the sheet. Again this affords us a rare glimpse into the technique of printing bilingual versions of a print for consumption both at home and abroad (a German version also exists, copying the Visscher plate in reverse with German verse and labels). This funeral procession wends its way towards a mausoleum, the coffin of Truce, covered in a pall inscribed with her name, being borne on the shoulders of twelve bearers, one for each year of the duration of the truce. The text makes clear that it is the fault of the Spanish and their Catholic supporters in the Netherlands that the Twelve Year Truce has broken down.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A third and later mock-funeral print is <span class=\"italic\">The Funeral of the Low Church or the Whig's last Will and Testament</span> published in 1710.<sup>iv</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A fully diplomatic transcription of the verses on the English sheet follows:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        THE FVNERAL OBSEQVES OF Sr. ALL=IN NEW FASHIONS:\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">1</span><br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">Gallantes; Sr. All in new Fashions is Dead;<br>\n        Behold His hearse, Carried in Solemne Sorte:<br>\n        His Wench 6 Weekes (through griefe) hath kept her Bedd.<br>\n        Those men who Liud by him are all amorte;</span><sup>v</sup> <br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">Liud by him said I; noe, I am mistooke,<br>\n        He Liud by them: his names in each mans Booke.</span><sup>vi</sup> <br>\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">2</span><br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">His Breeches, Dublet, Buffe coate,</span><sup>vii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">Hatt and Fether;<br>\n        his Spurres, Bootes, Garters, Gloues, Sword and Dagger;<br>\n        instead of Flagges; are carried all to geather;<br>\n        and other toyes, where with he used to swagger,<br>\n        As Long Coate, Capeles Cloake,</span><sup>viii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">Ruffes, fallinge Bands<br>\n        all fashions Lately brought from forreyne Lands.</span><br>\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">3</span><br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">IF you Desire to see these thinges Agayne;<br>\n        (for Fashions [ ; ] Ebb and flow as doth the Tyde)<br>\n        Then make repayre, to Hounsditch, or Long Lane;<br>\n        And there they Hange as Trophies of his Pride.<br>\n        His Credit (with His Lyfe) being ended Here<br>\n        tis thought hes gone, in Hell to Domynere.</span><sup>ix</sup> \n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">F.P.

As things stand, the earliest extant impression is entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Hunting after Money</span> and bears the imprint, <span class=\"italic\">London: Printed and Sold by Edward Midwinter, at the Star in Pye-Corner near West-Smithfield</span>.<sup>i</sup>  It is undated, but one copy of the two impressions known is priced and dated in Narcissus Luttrell's hand, <span class=\"italic\">2d. 27. August. 1709</span>. Copies of both impressions are at Harvard, one of them—fittingly—in the Baker Library of that University's Graduate School of Business, and it is one of these which is accompanied by a set of verses which are transcribed here, which do not appear in the British Museum version.<sup>ii</sup>   </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">Thanks to the Literature Online database [LION] I am able to say that approximately one fifth of the verse lines of <span class=\"italic\">The Hunting after Money</span> are taken from Robert Gould's <span class=\"italic\">The corruption of the times by money, a satyr</span>, published in 1693. The lines so used are numbered in the margin against the transcription below. The composer of the verses accompanying our image seems not to have looked at it too carefully, however, for though he writes, <span class=\"italic\">The Poet's Fancy gave it wings to fly, And ev'ry one is Hunting it full cry</span>, which fully accords with the engraving, he then adds <span class=\"italic\">Whether 'thas Legs or no, I cannot say</span>—which is odd seeing that the coin has clearly been given legs by the artist. But he must at least have had a fairly good description to work on, for he writes that <span class=\"italic\">The Smooth-Tongu'd Flatterer drives on amain, Thro' Hazard, and thro' Rapin</span>, hunts for Gain—and Flattery's dogs are indeed so labelled on the sheet—and that <span class=\"italic\">The Frugal Man hunts it with Pain and Toil… But he's too Honest, for you'll always find, That Diligence, and Industry come far behind</span>, again including two of the names of <span class=\"italic\">Frugallity's</span> dogs. </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">Cross was a prolific engraver of portraits and book-illustrations, though is generally agreed to be a decidedly second-rate artist, and is only known to have engraved one other broadside, the same plate being re-used as the frontispiece to <span class=\"italic\">Symptomes of Growth and Decay in Godliness</span> (1673).</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">The present engraving depicts an Allegorical Hunt<sup>iii</sup>  in which a winged coin on legs flees from a party hunting it on foot who are labelled, <span class=\"italic\">Frugallity, Flattery, Prodigallity</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Covetousnes</span>, and whose dogs, are named, respectively, <span class=\"italic\">Dilligence, Industry and Labour; Rapin</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Hazard</span>; [<span class=\"italic\">Prodigallity</span> needs no dog, of course, as he is still adequately provided with coin], and <span class=\"italic\">Deceit</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Usury</span>. <span class=\"italic\">Frugallity</span> is so very, proverbially, frugal that he carries his shoes over his shoulder for fear of wearing them out by walking on them,<sup>iv</sup> and <span class=\"italic\">Prodigallity</span> merely tosses coins into the air while trampling on the sword and scales labelled <span class=\"italic\">Justice</span>. </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">Once again, however—as so often in the history of early modern English prints—this striking allegory is not an original conception, but is copied from a late sixteenth-century engraving, <span class=\"italic\">Currite, nam pretio…</span>, by Hendrick Goltzius, issued in the Netherlands by Philips Galle (d.1612). The Goltzius original was discussed by Ilja Veldman, who notes that the (wingless) coin on legs bears the image of a crowned woman holding a cornucopia while seated on an out-of-kilter world-orb.<sup>v</sup>  The legend inscribed around the coin's perimeter refers to Ecclesiastes 10.19: <span class=\"italic\">Money answereth all things</span>. Cross's winged coin on legs, however, bears a laureate bust facing to the right and a legend which is illegible.<sup>vi</sup>  </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">The major difference in Cross's adaptation of the scene, however, is that his <span class=\"italic\">Prodigallity</span> is a man walking, not a woman riding, and his <span class=\"italic\">Flattery</span> is similarly walking, whereas in the Goltzius print, <span class=\"italic\">Adulator</span> in cockerel-headed cap kneels before <span class=\"italic\">Prodigalitas</span>, and holds a foxtail duster behind his back (a symbolic detail which was probably quite obscure to Cross).<sup>vii</sup> Cross's <span class=\"italic\">Flattery</span>, though interestingly he retains the cockerel-headed hat [i.e. the coxcomb's cock's comb], is not noticeably flattering anyone in particular! And Goltzius's <span class=\"italic\">Prodigalitas</span> rides down the personification of <span class=\"italic\">Iustitia</span>, whereas Cross's <span class=\"italic\">Prodigallity</span> merely treads on her sword and scales. The character labelled <span class=\"italic\">Frugallity</span> on the English sheet is presumably Cross's translation of Goltzius's label <span class=\"italic\">Parsimonia</span>, and yet that name properly belongs to one of this hunter's dogs. All the other dogs on the Goltzius sheet are named, so it seems certain that this name belongs to the dog, not the man, whose name is surely <span class=\"italic\"></span>Victus et Amictus [Food & Clothing], the label which appears just above his head. Goltzius's <span class=\"italic\">Auaritia</span>, like all such Latin personifications is grammatically, and here, it would seem, humanly, feminine, though Cross's <span class=\"italic\">Covetousnes</span>, about to let slip his dogs <span class=\"italic\">Usury</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Deceit</span>, is a luxuriously-bearded man.</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">According to Veldman, 'The title of the [Goltzius]print is boldly satirical, <span class=\"italic\">Run as best you may, for money alone matters, money confers honour, money procures friendship, heaven itself may be bought with riches</span>', which she identifies as a conflation of quotations from Ovid's <span class=\"italic\">Fasti</span> and the <span class=\"italic\">Argonautica</span> of Valerius Flaccus, while 'The lines of French and Dutch verse beneath the print explain that each pursuer will always have reasons of his own for chasing after the money. It becomes clear, however, that the poor devil striving to achieve wealth through honest toil will always come off worst.' The writer of the verses to our engraving rehearses the same complaint: <span class=\"italic\">The Frugal Man hunts it with Pain and Toil… But he's too Honest, for you'll always find, That Diligence, and Industry come far behind; He Labours hard, but Knaves outstrip him far</span>.</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">There is a French print on the same theme, roughly contemporary with ours, entitled <span class=\"italic\">La Chasse de 'Mon Oye'</span> [The hunt after 'my goose']. It depicts a number of people chasing a goose [<span class=\"italic\">oye</span>], punning on the word for money [<span class=\"italic\">monoye</span>, older form of modern French, monnaie]. There is an impression in the Douce print collection now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; it bears the imprints, <span class=\"italic\">A Paris chez P. Mariette rue S. Iacques a lesperance and A Paris chez P. Ferdinand, au Fauxbourg S. Germain, r.d. Seine</span>, the latter apparently over an earlier imprint.</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">\n         TRANSCRIPTION\n         </p>\n\n         <p class=\"pb-2\"> \n         When the bright World was fram'd, and all Things plac'd,<br>\n         In perfect Order, that before lay wast:<br>\n         The Sea in Bounds, the Earth its Teeming knew,<br>\n         And all her Fruitful Product kindly grew:<br>\n         The World was Happy, no Corruption found,<br>\n         But did with ev'ry useful Thing abound;<br>\n         Till Satan, who lay Lurking still to find,<br>\n         Some Way to prey on, and seduce Mankind,<br>\n         Invented Money to corrupt the Mind.<br>\n         <br> \n         The Bait was swallow'd, Money had the Name,<br>\n         Then Theft and Rapin soon in Fashion came.<br>\n         Friend did his Friend, Neighbour his Neighbour cheat,<br>\n         And all the Wold [sic] grew Knavery and Deceit:<br>\n         No Vice there was, but Money wou'd procure;<br>\n         Cut Throats, or turn the honest Damsel Whore.<br>\n         Money] MONEY, of all grand Evils sure the worst,<br>\n         Without it Discontent, and with it Curst;<br>\n         <br> \n         For where one hoards it to a Happy Use,<br>\n         Ten Thousand do the Blessing on't abuse:<br>\n         Strange Chams<sup>viii</sup> that Men should such a Value place,<br>\n         To be in Love with Caesar's Royal Face;<br>\n         Else where's the Intrinsick Value to be seen,<br>\n         Unless to purchase ev'ry kind of Sin.<br>\n         <br>\n         What Guilt, what Mischief, Cruelty and Rage?<br>\n         Has powerful Gold produc'd in ev'ry Age!<br>\n         Rob, Trick and Cheat, do ev'ry Thing that's ill;<br>\n         Be Rich and be as Wicked as you will.<br>\n         Take but a View of all that you can see,<br>\n         Of each Religion, Calling and Degree;<br>\n         Lords, Lacqueys, Juglers, Courtiers, Knaves and Fools,<br>\n         Punks, Players, Pimps, and Bawds, withal the Shoal<br>\n         Of busie Tradesmen that Encompass Pauls:<br>\n         Mark to what Centre all their Actions tend,<br>\n         And see if Money's not their only End.<sup>ix</sup><br>\n         <br>\n         The Poet's Fancy gave it wings to fly,<br>\n         And ev'ry one is Hunting it full cry:<br>\n         Whether 'thas Legs or no, I cannot say,<br>\n         But this I'm sure 'twill run like Dirt away.<br>\n         <br>\n         Covetious [sic] ] See, with Pains, each gaping Wretch pursues<br>\n         The glitt'ring Bait, fearing the Prize to lose:<br>\n         The Miser with Extortion and Deceit,<br>\n         Hunts after Gain, and hopes to hoard more yet;<br>\n         Half starves his Carcass to encrease his Store,<br>\n         And in the midst of his Plenty Poor;<br>\n         And tho' by Fraud he has purchas'd an Estate,<br>\n         Labours for more, and does but beg in State.<br>\n         All Worldly Int'rests does to Heav'n prefer,<br>\n         And to his crowded Bags makes all his Prayer;<br>\n         As tho' his Mony would his Crimes defray,<br>\n         Or bribe his Jury on the Judgment Day:<br>\n         Then will he feel, and feeling rue, how vain<br>\n         It was to trust in Curst Ill gotten Gain.<br>\n         When Death's grim Summons he must strait obey,<br>\n         Nor bear the Wealth he so admires away.<br>\n         <br>\n         Flattery] The Smooth-Tongu'd Flatterer drives on amain,<br>\n         Thro' Hazard, and thro' Rapin, hunts for Gain;<br>\n         He's next in Scent, for wicked Ways thrives best,<br>\n         A subtle Knave will soonest feather his Nest,<br>\n         By Bribes and Flattery, tho' he Thousands gets,<br>\n         Yet scorns in all his Pride to pay his Debts:<br>\n         Haughty, yet condescends to crush the Poor,<br>\n         To cram his Belly, or to pay his Whore.<sup>x</sup><br>\n         <br> \n         Frugality] The Frugal Man hunts it with Pain and Toil,<br>\n         And hopes to get a Share too of the Spoil;<br>\n         But he's too Honest, for you'll always find,<br>\n         That Diligence, and Industry come far behind;<br>\n         He Labours hard, but Knaves outstrip him far;<br>\n         Villains and Fool, still Fortunes Fav'rites are.<br>\n         A modest Man shall be Carrest,<br>\n         But still be Poor, and by the World Opprest.<br>\n         <br>\n         Prodigal] But here comes one that contradicts 'em all,<br>\n         That Golden Ass, that Spenthrift Prodigal!<br>\n         Preposterous Fop!

It must therefore date some time after Davis's return from France in 1675, though the only known state bearing Henry Overton's imprint must belong to the earlier part of the eighteenth century (active 1707-51). In the verses the Doctor confesses that, 'tho I in a Velvet Coat Appear / I am not worth one single Groat a Year'.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Our present <span class=\"italic\">Infallible Mountebank, or Quack Doctor</span><sup>iii</sup>  shows the Doctor on stage holding out a paper (a testimonial letter?) in one hand, and a tiny phial in the other, his chest of drugs and performing monkey at his feet, and his 'merry andrew' dressed like a harlequin appearing from behind a curtain and pointing at him.<sup>iv</sup>  The print is undated, though another simplified woodcut version bears an imprint with the date 1707, <sup>v</sup>  and a clear <span class=\"italic\">terminus post quem</span> is provided by Marcellus Laroon's <span class=\"italic\"></span>Mountabanck from which it plainly derives, published as part of his <span class=\"italic\">Cryes of the City of London Drawne after the Life </span>(1688), engraved by John Savage.<sup>vi</sup>  Laroon's model was said to have been one Hans Buling, a quack of Dutch extraction, apparently, who enjoyed some notoriety in London in the 1670s.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The text which accompanies the print appears in Motteux's play <span class=\"italic\">Farewel folly: or, the younger the wiser. A comedy as it is acted at the Theatre Royal. With a musical interlude, call'd The mountebank: or, the humours of the fair</span>, published in 1707, though it is known to have been earlier staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in January 1705.<sup>vii</sup>  While 'songs from the shows' would often be printed and issued separately—and the singling out of the 'musical interlude' on the title-page of the play is tantamount to implying such separate publication—the present sheet prints the lyric but no music. Perhaps our print might better be considered as one of the earliest illustrations of a scene as acted in a stage-play. There is at least one (easily missed) detail to support this suggestion—the pair of cuckold's horns the 'zany' holds above his head. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">We learn from the 'Mountebank 's Zany's Speech' in Motteux's play that his Master's name is 'Kill-mob', incidentally, and it is evident from the speech that during the course of his patter he produces various unsavoury relics which testify to the efficacy of the quack's cures, including: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">'this Hide-clearing, wrinkle-smoothing, Snout-adorning Butter of Beauty… his Superexcellent Nostrum … It makes the Lame, See, and the Blind Walk…'Twill do yet more, 'twill make a Woman hold her Tongue… this Precious Stone… He took it out of the Great Mogul's Pimp's Bladder, with the Point of an Oyster Knife... this small Butter-tooth, he wheadl'd out of the Nether Jaw of a Frow, who caught Cold on a Visiting Day, for want of her Stove…'</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">'And this Short Excrescence (as like a Horn as ever you saw since you were born) out of the Forehead of one of the Dons of Cuckold's-haven'</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It is this last detail of the zany's <span class=\"italic\">spiel</span> that explains the curious pair of horns fitted with a handle which he brandishes above his head, his pointing at his Master perhaps cheekily insinuating that he not only can cure cuckolds but is himself one too.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The precise date of our print is of more than 'academic' significance, it is also of the greatest interest to students of traditional drama, in that the doggerel lines below the image in which the mountebank boasts of the many diseases he can cure—many of them non-existent and nonsensical—are practically identical to those used by the Quack-doctor in the English mummers' play, and may thus have important implications for dating the plays. (Full text given below.)  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It must have been relatively popular, for a surprising number of impressions of the sheet survive, as well as other versions, e.g. with image re-engraved in reverse, or in woodcut.<sup>viii</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Another English quack-doctor print is the marvellously-titled <span class=\"italic\">Pharmacopola Circumforaneus, Or The Horse Doctor's Harangue to the Credulous Mob </span>[1714].<sup>ix</sup> It depicts the well-dressed Doctor and his assistant on horseback, handing out papers or packets to an eager crowd, and it too is accompanied by a lengthy, extravagant text. Stephens pointed out that in alluding to 'Signior Hanesio', i.e. Jo. Haines, the anonymous author of the present text closely based his opening paragraph on <span class=\"italic\">Jo. Haine's 2d Letter to Will's Coffee-house</span>, as published in <span class=\"italic\">A Continuation or Second Part of the Letters from the Dead to the Living</span> by Tom Brown, vol. 2 (2nd ed., 1707).<sup>x</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">An Apish Mountebanck</span> is how a scene featuring three monkeys in a late seventeenth-century 'panorama' held in the Yale Center for British Art is labelled. While one of the apes sits on a bench, another appears to be examining his foot, while a third holds what is presumably a urine-flask. In fact, the group derives from a similar group in a mid-seventeenth-century Dutch <span class=\"italic\">singerie</span> of a barber-surgeon's shop engraved by Coryn Boel (d. 1668) after David Teniers the Younger.<sup>xi</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Before leaving the subject of quack doctors and their nostrums, we should note the real-life early seventeenth-century practitioner, Humphrey Bromley of Shrewsbury, whose German advertisement survives uniquely in the collection of Strasbourg University Library. His advertisement is headed by a woodcut image of a creature intended to be a hippopotamus—as that was the secret ingredient in the panacea he was touting about—and the text claims he has satisfied customers even amongst the crowned heads of Europe. Co-incidentally, we hear of him again in Norwich in 1616, when he is recorded as having been granted</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">'libertie to shewe in some howse within this Citty A strange Child with two heades And that by the space of two dayes and no more. But he ys forbidden to sound any Drumme or vse any other meanes to drawe company then onely the hangynge upp of the picture of the said Child.'<sup>xii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">'A strange Child with two heades' was presumably what we should now term conjoined (formerly, 'Siamese') twins, and presumably the unfortunate children were still alive, providing for 'Dr.' Bromley a lucrative income. The 'picture of the said Child' which the city authorities permitted him to hang up to advertise his show would presumably have been a poster-size version of the unfortunate children. Prints of conjoined twins are a subject in their own right, but not one we have space for here.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 font-bold\">\n        The Infallible Mountebank, or Quack Doctor (transcription)\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        SEE SIRS, see here!<br>\n        a Doctor rare,<br>\n        who travels much at home!<br>\n        Here take my Bills,<sup>xiii</sup> <br>\n        I cure all ills,<br>\n        past, present, and to come;<br>\n        The Cramp, the Stitch,<br>\n        The Squirt, the Itch,<br>\n        the Gout, the Stone the Pox;<br>\n        The Mulligrubs,<sup>xiv</sup> <br>\n        The Bonny Scrubs,<sup>xv</sup> <br>\n        and all Pandora's Box;<br>\n        Thousands I've Dissected,<br>\n        Thousands new erected,<sup>xvi</sup> <br> \n        and such Cures effected,<br>\n        as none e're can tell.<br>\n        Let the Palsie shake ye,<br>\n        Let the Chollick rack ye,<br>\n        Let the Crinkums<sup>xvii</sup> break ye,<br>\n        Let the Murrain<sup>xviii</sup> take you;<br>\n        take this and you are well.<br>\n        Come wits so keen,<br>\n        Devour'd with Spleen;<br>\n        come Beaus who sprain'd your Backs,<br>\n        Great Belly'd Maids,<sup>xix</sup> <br> \n        Old Founder'd Jades,<br>\n        and Pepper'd Vizard Cracks.<sup>xx</sup> <br> \n        I soon remove,<br>\n        The Pains of Love,<br>\n        and cure the Love-Sick Maid;<br>\n        The Hot, the Cold,<br>\n        The Young, the Old,<br>\n        the Living, and the Dead.<br>\n        I clear the Lass,<br>\n        With Wainscot Face,<sup>xxi</sup> <br>\n        and from Pimginets<sup>xxii</sup> free;<br>\n        Plump Ladies Red,<br>\n        Like Saracen's Head,<br>\n        with Toaping Rattafia.<sup>xxiii</sup> <br>\n        This with a Firk,<sup>xxiv</sup> <br> \n        will do your Work,<br>\n        and Scour you o're and o're,<br>\n        Read, Judge and Try,<br>\n        And if you Die,<br>\n        never believe me more. \n        </p>\n\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">See R.Porter, <cite>Quacks, Fakers and Charlatans in English Medicine</cite> (London, 2000). </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">M.A. Katritzky, 'Marketing Medicine: the Image of the Early Modern Mountebank', <cite>Renaissance Studies</cite>, 15 (2001), pp. 121-53. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Impressions known to me include British Museum, Department of Prints & Drawings, 1850, 1109.3, and British Library, C.121.g 9 (211).  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Interestingly, this design was used as the model for an English delftware plate bearing the date 1750, but present whereabouts unknown.

As early as the 1620s at least two engravings depict them sitting in council, plotting round a table, and in another Print in Focus we will note the <span class=\"italic\">Ignatians' conclave</span> in the hell-scene of the probably contemporary <span class=\"italic\">Powder Treason</span> sheet. One of the <span class=\"italic\"></span>Three Grand Enimies to Church and State portrayed in the engraved frontispiece to Sheppard's <span class=\"italic\">The Times Displayed in Six Sestyads</span> (1646) is <span class=\"italic\">Jesuitecall Pollicie</span>, whose caption opens, <span class=\"italic\">Till Antechrist shall ruind bee Great combustions wee must see...</span> The engraved frontispiece to <span class=\"italic\">The Plots of Jesuites…</span> (1653) continues this theme, showing the pope, cardinal and priests also seated round a table plotting, as the title goes on to say, <span class=\"italic\">How to bring England to the Romane Religion without tumult</span>. One of the three Jesuit tracts included in it is by Robert Parsons (d. 1610), who notoriously encouraged Philip II of Spain to invade and convert England. It is a pity that what was evidently a broadside satire listed in Stent's 1662 advertisement as <span class=\"italic\">Cornelius of Dort brings Parsons to confession</span> has not come down to us, but <span class=\"italic\">The Jesuits Loyalty</span> (1677) includes portraits of both Parsons and Garnet.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A book issued in 1641 entitled <span class=\"italic\">The rat-trap: or, The Jesuites taken in their owne Net, &c. Discovered in this yeare of Jubilee, or Deliverance from the Romish faction</span>, includes a woodcut of a <span class=\"italic\">Jesuiticall Romist</span> who <span class=\"italic\">with a rusty dagger, stabbed Justice Heywood, as he was going to the parliament house to deliver up a catalog of divers papists and Jesuites names…</span> and this is presumably the incident responsible for the inclusion of the word <span class=\"italic\"></span>Daggers that issues from the mouth of the Jesuit in Vicars' <span class=\"italic\">November the 5, 1605. The Qvintessence of Cruelty</span>. Similarly, <span class=\"italic\">The Solemn Mock procession</span> that took place in London on November 17th 1679 included <span class=\"italic\">Six Jesuits with bloody daggers</span> (see further below).</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A more significant and compendious image is the engraved frontispiece to <span class=\"italic\">Pyrotechnica Loyalana, Ignatian fireworks</span> (1667), which suggests that the Jesuits were responsible for the previous year's Great Fire of London (depicted at the top left of the composition), and two men, one of them a Jesuit, are shown taking flammable materials into a London house—opposite this scene, the familiar image of Fawkes about to enter the cellars of Parliament. An enthroned Pope fans the flames of the burning city with bellows, while a Jesuit priest with the legend <span class=\"italic\">ab igne natus</span> [born of the fire] written on his back, punning on Loyola's forename, releases yoked foxes with firebrands tied to their tails (Samson's stratagem against the Philistines as recorded in Judges 15.4), and by pointing, links the house-burners with a man labelled Hubert (a simple-minded French Protestant watch-maker who falsely confessed to starting the fire), who is receiving a fire-bomb from another Jesuit priest with the initials P.H. (see further below). The designer may have taken some of this imagery from Faithorne's far more accomplished print of Cromwell issued nine years previously.

The first of the twelve constituent scenes of <span class=\"italic\">The popish Damnable Plot against our Religion and Liberties (December 1680) describes the Burning of London, which hath been proved undeniably by Dr. Oates… to be contrived and carried on by the Papists</span>. Indeed, the myth was preserved into modern times, by the inscription on the Monument commemorating the Fire. <span class=\"italic\">The Happy Instruments of Englands Preservation</span> (April 1681) shows the Pope in conclave with four cardinals and eight Jesuits recognisable by their distinctive bonnets, one of whom holds a commission inscribed to <span class=\"italic\">fire the City</span>, another—reprising Garnet and <span class=\"italic\">The Pope's Pardon</span>—holds up a dagger, on his scroll the words, <span class=\"italic\">The daggers consecrated and heres my Pardon</span>.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">And London is shown burning in various anti-Catholic sheets, e.g. <span class=\"italic\">The Catholick Gamesters or A Dubble Match of Bowleing </span>(February 1680) engraved by Stephen College, which also includes six bonneted Jesuits (all identified by name) above the caption, <span class=\"italic\">London Burnt by Popish preists</span> [sic] <span class=\"italic\">and Jesuits Sep: 2 1666</span>. Two carry torches while two hurl fire-bombs at the burning buildings. One of them is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Harcourt</span>—there were several contemporary English Jesuits who used this name, and it may be that he is identical with the mysterious P.H. of the earlier <span class=\"italic\">Pyrotechnica Loyalana</span>, the P. being perhaps the abbreviation of a title, such as Provincial or Procurator, rather than a forename.<sup>i</sup>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">On the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's death in the years 1679-81 the staunchly anti-Catholic Whig party organised huge 'solemn mock processions' which paraded their way rowdily through the City. The 1681 crowd smashed the windows of a tavern that was still unwisely trading at the sign of The Pope's Head.<sup>ii</sup>  An establishment of the same name in Cornhill had prudently changed its name to The Bishop's Head as long ago as 1542, and another in Southwark to The King's Head in the same year!<sup>iii</sup>  The prose <span class=\"italic\">Explanation</span> to the 1680 print opens:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">You must first know the occasion of this Mock Procession to have been, that the Pope, Fryars, and their Abettors here in England, contrived the Lamentable Burning of London; some Protestant Gentlemen, partly in a thankful Commemoration of their Deliverance, and partly to raise a just Abhorrency of such Popish practicers, do now bring these Incendiaries in Effigie to the Fire they have better deserved.</span>  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">One of the pageant floats included four Jesuits holding daggers, though, as we have noted, the previous year's procession had featured <span class=\"italic\">Six Jesuits with Bloody Daggers</span>.  </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">William Waring, for example, who was known in England as Harcourt, one of the Jesuits hanged at Tyburn on 20th June 1679, thanks to Oates's allegations, was Procurator of the English province by 1671 [ODNB].

While probably very few early modern English men and women would have wanted to go that far, lawyers were fair game as the target for visual satire throughout our period.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">A broadside ballad of c.1630 which offers general advice (e.g. <span class=\"italic\">keepe still in Compasse</span>—a maxim which was itself the subject of a fine Elizabethan print<sup>i</sup>   ) is also a general satire against Jesuits, quack doctors, whores, fortune-tellers and lawyers. Those who resort too readily to the last-named are addressed thus:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        You that for nothing<br>\n        will goe to Law,<br>\n        Vexing your neighbours,<br>\n        for a sticke or a straw,<br>\n        Because of your lawing,<br>\n        your purse will grow low:<br>\n        You'l prove your selves Coxe-combs<br>\n        I tell you but so.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Forget not I say,<br>\n        that Embleme so rare,<br>\n        Which teaches you how<br>\n        the Oyster to share,<br>\n        Thou must have one shell,<br>\n        the other thy foe,<br>\n        The fish is the Lawyers,<br>\n        I tell you but so.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">That anti-lawyer <span class=\"italic\">Embleme</span> so rare was, in fact, pictorialised in the early eighteenth century by the engravers John Simon<sup>ii</sup> and Sutton Nicholls; the latter's etching entitled, <span class=\"italic\">The Lawyer and his Clients</span>, from the form of address given, must have been issued c.1710, Simon's untitled mezzotint probably in the following decade.<sup>iii</sup>  <span class=\"italic\">Dobson pinx</span>. on the Nicholls print indicates it was etched after a lost painting by William Dobson (d.1646).</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">The broadside ballad and Dobson's lost painting are thus the earliest examples of the motif of which I am aware, but it was to enjoy considerable popularity throughout the rest of the century. <span class=\"italic\">Poor Robins Almanack</span> for 1665, like all English almanacs, lists the law terms,<sup>iv</sup> but adds anti-lawyer verses for each term, that for Michaelmas Term alluding to the subject of the present 'emblem' thus:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Two finds an Oyster, which they will not part,<br>\n        Both will have all or none, the Lawyers art<br>\n        Must end the strife; he fitts their humour well,<br>\n        Eats up the fish, and gives them each a shell.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">The caption to Nicholls' etching runs to two verses (only the first appears on Simon's mezzotint): </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Blind Plaintiff, lame Defendant Share<br>\n        The Friendly Laws impartial Care<br>\n        A Shell for Him a Shell for Thee<br>\n        The Middle is the Lawyers Fee.<br>\n        <br>  \n        When willful Blind doth Law Commence<br>\n        And Lame in Purs acts in Defence;<br>\n        The Lawyer gets the greatest Gains,<br>\n        And next to nought for them remains.<br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The first verse is also found in Matthew Prior's <span class=\"italic\">Two Beggars disputing their Right to an Oyster they had Found; a Lawyer thus decides the Cause </span>(?1720), though not therefore necessarily derived from it - it may  well have traditionally accompanied the anecdote and have simply been quoted by Prior -- an anecdote which was also the subject of Ned Ward's tenth fable, <span class=\"italic\"></span>The Plaintiff and Defendant, which appeared in his <span class=\"italic\">Aesop at Tunbridge or, A few select Fables in Verse</span> (1698). A single unillustrated sheet published in Dublin in 1727 entitled <span class=\"italic\">A satyr on the lawyers concerning two clowns and an oyster</span> also retells the story, also in verse. Late in the century our 'emblem' was again the subject of a mezzotint compositionally based on Simon's but now moved to an indoor setting, issued by R. Sayer & J. Bennet in 1779 (re-issued by Sayer alone in 1787),<sup>v</sup> and of another contemporary mezzotint also in an indoor setting but compositionally different, published by Carrington Bowles under the title, <span class=\"italic\">A Sharp Between Two Flats</span>.   I know of two impressions of Simon's mezzotint, that in the British Museum was published by Edward Cooper,<sup>vi</sup>that in the Library of Congress, Washington, by John Smith.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">The notion that the lawyer is only too likely to 'fleece' both parties in any dispute is instanced again in a detail represented in a magnificent print probably issued in the 1620s entitled <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/4`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">The Common Weales Canker Worms</router-link>.<sup>viii</sup>  Not only does he say to the men who precede him in the order, <span class=\"italic\">I fleece these five</span>, but his 'emblem'<sup>ix</sup> is the fox about to pounce on the simple goose, with the disturbing motto, <span class=\"italic\">Legem pone!</span> [Set aside the law], while his verse reads as follows: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        What lett fall such an advantageous cause,<br>\n        And beare such wronges why tis against the lawes,<br>\n        Ile prosecute it & uppon my troth,<br>\n        Ile never leave it till I haue fleecd you bothe [i.e. both parties to the case].\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Another instance of a lawyer shown accepting purses—fees, or more likely, bribes—from both parties in a case, can be seen as the detail which occupies the top two quarters of the shield which features as part of a burlesque coat of arms. <span class=\"italic\">The lawyers coat of arms, dedicated to their clients for the use of Michaelmas Term</span> is undated,<sup>x</sup> but an advertisement in The Post Boy of 21-24 February 1708, which cites the full title as just given verbatim, states that it is to be had from <span class=\"italic\">J. Morphew near Stationers Hall</span>.<sup>xi</sup> The verse describes the burlesque coat well enough and includes a reference to this inset scene:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"italic\">Nay; rather than his Modesty he'll hide,<br>\n        He'll take a Private Dawb</span><sup>xii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">o't'other side:</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The crest is a fox-headed lawyer (hence the verse's <span class=\"italic\"></span>Sly Volpone and <span class=\"italic\"></span>old Reynard), and the motto <span class=\"italic\">Dum vivo thrivo</span> [While I live, I thrive]. It seems likely that it was still being sold in the 1760s, because Dicey & Marshall's catalogue of that date lists a woodcut print of <span class=\"italic\">The Lawyers Coat of Arms, &c. Or, a Looking-Glass to all hasty, unthinking, and Purse-proud People, fit to be seen by all Degrees and Stations of People</span>, in which description the word <span class=\"italic\">purse-proud</span> which is used in the verse of the early eighteenth-century version is particularly suggestive of the identity with that print. Of particular interest is the fact that the image of the burlesque coat was transfer-printed c.1760 onto the inside of Liverpool delftware punch-bowls.<sup>xiii</sup></p>\n\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Uniquely preserved in Harvard University's Houghton Library, albeit in an eighteenth-century impression. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">There are impressions of the mezzotint by John Simon in the Library of Congress in Washington and in the British Museum, Department of Prints & Drawings, 1874,0808.2304—they bear slightly different imprint information (see below).  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">I base this latter estimate on Simon's biography as given on the British Museum database: <cite>Early work for Edward Cooper ; by c.1720 published most plates himself</cite>.  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">The rhyme—as given in the print-captions—is found, for example, in the 1733 edition of <cite>Poor Richard's Almanack</cite> where it is entitled <cite>The Benefit of Going to Law</cite>. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Offered for sale by Bloomsbury Auctions on 15 April 2007. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">BM Satires 3762; described in F.G.Stephens, <cite>Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum: Satirical and Personal Subjects</cite>, vol. 3, part 1 (London, 1877), p. 1250. </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">BM Satires 1284.

Also variety of Land-skips, and small Figures for Shashes</span>.<sup>ii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">But already in the earliest known printseller's advertisement—that of Peter Stent issued in 1654—the use to which several of his sets of prints might be put is suggested, e.g.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        12 Plates for cheez trenchers<br>\n        2 Plates of Signes or Badges for Innes, or Taverns. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">With this last item, which has become <span class=\"italic\">Three plats</span> by the time of the 1662 advertisement, compare, from Arthur Tooker's <span class=\"italic\">A Catalogue of Plates</span> (1675), under <span class=\"italic\">Plates of Mr. Gaywoods Etching, invented by Mr. Barlow and others</span>,</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          <span class=\"italic\">Two</span> [plates of] <span class=\"italic\">Badges or Choice of Signs for Bars and Rooms</span>. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In his annotations to Samuel Pepys's collection of prints, Aspital suggested that the three engraved sheets of inn-signs, fifteen per sheet, which unfortunately bear no imprint information, may have been the ones appearing in Stent's advertisements.<sup>iii</sup>  Certainly <span class=\"italic\">The Kings head</span> is that of Charles II and on the same sheet, I note that the final sign—where the printer's name and address might be expected, if there were one—is <span class=\"italic\">The White Horse</span>, which was Stent's address. Unknown to Globe, in Douce Prints Portfolio 139, now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, are two such sheets of signs (one fragmentary) bearing the imprint of Stent's successor, John Overton.<sup>iv</sup> A very similar sheet, but in which the signs are disposed vertically in five rows of three, rather than in three rows of five as in the Pepys sheets, is to be found in the Banks collection in the British Museum.<sup>v</sup>   </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">While it might be thought such sheets could have served as designs for sign-painters, the wording of Stent's and Tooker's entries, the latter in particular—<span class=\"italic\"></span>Badges or... Signs for Bars and Rooms—may rather imply that they were to be cut up and used to name rooms or bars within large establishments, and not necessarily those dispensing alcoholic liquors. In Shakespeare's <span class=\"italic\">Henry IV</span> plays (c.1597-8) we learn that the Boar's-Head tavern in East Cheap had rooms named <span class=\"italic\">Half-moon, Pomgarnet</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Dolphin</span>, and in Jonson's <span class=\"italic\">Bartholomew Fair</span> (1614), we hear of an inn-room called <span class=\"italic\">Coney</span>—signs of the <span class=\"italic\">Half-moon</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Dolphin</span> appear on the Banks sheet.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">Presumably cashing in on immediate post-Restoration enthusiasm, Stent's 1662 advertisement also lists </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          <span class=\"italic\">Small pieces of the King Queen, Princess, Dukes of York, Glocester, Albemarl, Royal Oake, Healing the Kings Evil and such like, 12 plats, for to adorn Tobacco-boxes, much in use.</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">We hear of just such an image of Charles II used strategically by a former Parliamentarian now turned Royalist in the <span class=\"italic\">Preface</span> to L'Estrange's <span class=\"italic\">Apology</span> (1660):</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          <span class=\"italic\">Out comes the Spruce Tobacco-Box, with the King's Picture at it, which he Wears, and Kisses, not so much out of Kindnesse, and Devotion, as for a Hint, and Introduction, to his Politiques, now at hand.<sup>vi</sup> </span>\n        </p>\n        \n        <p class=\"pb-2\">By the very end of our period, prints might appear on handkerchiefs too, and the Victoria & Albert Museum currently exhibits one such dated 1707 and printed with a celebration of Marlborough's victories. Another contemporary printed handkerchief has the Twelve Months as its subject.</p>\n\n        \n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Tooker's 1675 <span class=\"italic\">Catalogue</span>, under <span class=\"italic\">Several sorts of Plates by divers Authors</span>, also lists</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          <span class=\"italic\">Sixty Stories of variety of Landskips and Ovals with neat borders, and a variety of Beasts, Birds, Hunting, Trees, Worms, Fruit, Flowers, Fishes, &c. Coloured fit for Cabinets, Dressing-boxes, Powder-boxes, Baskets, Skreens, &c.</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In her <span class=\"italic\">Supplement to the Queen-like Closet</span> (1674) Hannah Woolley taught her gentlewomen readers how to adorn cabinets, stands and biscuit-plates with prints or parts thereof—in a significant antedating of the Victorian enthusiasm for <span class=\"italic\">découpage</span>.<sup>vii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Walton's advertisement from which we have quoted above, continues with a list of the various craftspeople to whom such prints may be of use as design sources:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          <span class=\"italic\">also extraordinary [sic] useful for Goldsmiths, Jewelers, Chasers, Gravers, Painters, Carvers, Embroiderers, Drawers, Needle-women, and all Handicrafts.</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">And we might add, tilers too, for prints were also copied in tile: indeed, nine tiles hand-painted after printed designs charting incidents in the Popish Plot (which also appeared as pictorial playing-cards) survive in the Victoria & Albert Museum, representing what the Museum's online catalogue describes as 'the start of tin-glazed wall tile production in this country'.<sup>viii</sup>   </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Overton's advertisement of 1673 boasts <span class=\"italic\">Five Hundred New sorts of Birds, Beasts, Fish, Flies, Wormes, Flowers, Fruites, Figures, Histories, Landskips, Ovals, Neately cut in Copper, and neatly coloured, for Gentlewomens works, and he is doing more as time will permit</span>, as well as taking a swipe at his rival, Robert Walton: <span class=\"italic\">Iohn Overton... hath more then ten times the choice and stock that R.W. hath, though he vapors that he is the oldest man</span>.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Many prints will undoubtedly have been put to such decorative use by the craftspeople mentioned in the advertisements, but a few will have been specifically aimed at younger viewers, like the eighteenth-century 'lotteries', and may have been cut up for use in card and other games, or as an aid to reading.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Certain classes of print were <span class=\"italic\">designed</span> for applied use: they are mostly small in size as they were intended to decorate small boxes (for pills or tobacco) or other artefacts of specific shape—such as circular 'banqueting' trenchers.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">Trenchers</span> in this sense are thin wooden roundels, often little bigger than a modern circular drinks coaster or beer-mat, that are believed to have been used for the final course of the early modern banquet, in the Elizabethan and Jacobean era in particular. They are usually decorated on one side only, the side on which fruit, cheese, and sweetmeats are thought to have been served, while the other side (which remained face-down during the meal) is either painted with some pictorial design and verse/motto, or—our present concern—has an engraved print pasted to it.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Several museums possess either complete sets of such trenchers, or sorry and sometimes lone survivors from sets. In fact, in the earliest advertisement of the stock of the London print-seller Peter Stent, of 1654, we read of <span class=\"italic\">12 Plates for cheez trenchers</span>, and <span class=\"italic\">6 plates of Mr Marshal's for Trenchers</span>. Though some rectangular examples do exist,<sup>ix</sup> trenchers are overwhelmingly circular in form, and as illustrated in the advertisement, the standard number in a set is a dozen, though half-dozens are also encountered. It will thus come as no surprise to learn that the most popular subject found pasted on surviving sets is the Months, but other dozens include the Sibyls (even though conventionally only ten in number), and twelve of Aesop's Fables—one of these three subjects could well be that mentioned in Stent's list. Fortunately, we can be certain of the identity of the half-dozen advertised, as the six circular prints in question engraved by William Marshall, survive uniquely in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington.<sup>x</sup>  In fact, they are emblems, and the circular emblem, a format first introduced into England with Wither's Collection of Emblemes of 1635 (originally engraved by Crispin de Passe), was clearly tailor-made for the normally circular trencher.<sup>xi</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The series of <span class=\"italic\">Months</span> published c.1630 attributed to the engraver Robert Vaughan (after de Passe), from which this month's print comes, must have been designed specifically for pasting to trenchers, for the perimeter inscription to March significantly opens, <span class=\"italic\">As trenchers thinn are made for fruite and cheese</span>... while the present May roundel interestingly styles the month's subject (the usual maying-party out in a boat) <span class=\"italic\">this Emblem</span>, before proceeding to moralise it.<sup>xii</sup>  This particular edition of the Months (and there were several editions extant to judge from surviving trencher sets<sup>xiii</sup> ) was certainly found on one of the earliest sets to be published, in <span class=\"italic\">The Gentleman's Magazine</span> for May 1793, p. 398, though the whereabouts of that particular set is now unknown.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Clearly these Months prints might be saved in an album—as was the case with our present example of the Collings issue—or cut out, pasted to a trencher, and varnished over. Omission of one or both the two concentric rings of inscription also allows for roundels of various diameters.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The upper verse outside the roundel in the Months series names the prominent saints' days which fall in the month in question, while the lower verse reflects in general (and usually agricultural) terms on the appropriate Labour of the Month.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The English perimeter verse to the present month is not unusual for this sort of verse in being capable of being read in a double sense:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Heere by this Emblem may be understood\n        That when a young man hath a pype that's good,\n        The maydes will listen after it with pleasure\n        And keepe theire tunes and times unto his measure\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Certainly, the male half of one of the couples in the boat is playing on a pipe, but given the sexual context of maying, and the innuendo in other verses of the series, it is, at least, suggestive.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The originator of this print series was Crispin de Passe the Elder who engraved The Months (after designs by Maarten de Vos) in Cologne probably in the 1590s. That such Months sets were available prior to the date of the English copies of de Passe's engravings we may be sure from a passing allusion to <span class=\"italic\">Twelve trenchers, upon every one a month... and their posies under 'em</span> in Middleton's <span class=\"italic\">No Wit, no Help Like a Woman's</span>, published in 1612 (II. i. 62ff.), though the actual verses quoted correspond to no known set. They were clearly a very popular series in England, however, though the number of English editions has yet to be properly sorted out. What follows is but 'work in progress'! I am aware of three different sets of vernacular perimeter verses. I quote the three versions for September, as only that month survives as a representative of Type 1:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        1<br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">September showes you playne of sondry sortes of ffishes<br>\n        Give God the praise that filleth thus your dishes.</span><sup>xiv</sup><br>\n        2<br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">The sea and land yields store of Fishe and fruit, most fishe [sic];<br>\n        Eate not to muche September wills, it may thy health ympayr.</span><sup>xv</sup> <br>\n        3<br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">Amongst all Creatures Woemen still are od<br>\n        Of fleshe or fish, they Cheifely love the Cod:<sup>xvi</sup> <br> \n        For if the Goodwife haue it not, noe doubte<br>\n        Her Husband shall be seru'd with Carpe and Powte.</span><sup>xvii</sup>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The history of the issue of the Type 3 set can be traced as follows:</p>\n\n        <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside py-2 mb-2\">\n          <li>Roger Daniel (c. 1629)—(erasure still visible under next)</li>\n          <li>Thomas Johnson (c. 1630)—British Museum Prints & Drawings 166 c.1 (2)</li>\n          <li>Matt Collings (1660s)—BM P&D 157* a.18</li>\n          <li>Robert Walton (active 1647-87)—Ashmolean, Douce E.2.6 (168)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It is notable that all three of the dozens known to have been pasted to trenchers, the <span class=\"italic\">Months, Sibyls</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Fables</span>, were being sold by the printseller Thomas Johnson c.1630; he seems to have inherited the stock of Roger Daniel after Daniel had moved from London to Cambridge the previous year, and indeed, an earlier state of the <span class=\"italic\">Sibyls</span> is known with Daniel's address.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">As a postscript, it is perhaps worth noting that the <span class=\"italic\">litterati</span> could not resist a sneer at the quality of the verse inscriptions on trenchers, whether painted or engraved. In his <span class=\"italic\">Art of English Poesy</span> (1589), however, Puttenham is not judgemental, neutrally stating that <span class=\"italic\">We call them</span> [sc. epigrams] <span class=\"italic\">posies, and do paint them nowadays upon the backsides of our trenchers of wood, or use them as devices in arms or in rings</span>. And, indeed, when John Heywood came to compose an epigram on his own <span class=\"italic\">Book of Epigrammes</span>, first published in 1555, the metaphorical resemblance of that work to a trencher seemed apposite: <span class=\"italic\">This booke maie seeme, as it sorteth in sute, A thin trym trencher to serue folke at frute</span>, but by 1597 Joseph Hall is referring dismissively to <span class=\"italic\">hunger-starved trencher poetry</span> (<span class=\"italic\">Satires</span> I. i. 13), and Milton couples such verses with ring-posies:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">Instead of well siz'd periods, he greets us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies. He has a fortune therefore good/ because he is content with it. This is a piece of sapience not worth the brain of a fruit-trencher.</span><sup>xviii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Middleton has one of his characters in <span class=\"italic\">The Old Law</span> (1627) refer sneeringly to <span class=\"italic\">running admonitions Upon cheese-trenchers</span>, and cites as an example of such an <span class=\"italic\">admonition</span>,</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"italic\">Take heed of whoring, shun it;<br>\n        'Tis like a cheese too strong of the runnet</span><sup>xix</sup> <br> \n        (II.i. 126ff.)\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">which is, admittedly, bathetic! In similarly dismissive vein, the vastly learned Robert Burton in his <span class=\"italic\">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1621) sarcastically concludes a long list of entirely serious maxims and adages with, <span class=\"italic\">Look for more in Isocrates, Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, etc., and for defect, consult with cheese-trenchers and painted cloths</span>.<sup>xx</sup></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Maybe it is the contempt of such 'canonical' writers that has led to the unaccountable scholarly neglect of the genre which, however, has much to reveal about contemporary <span class=\"italic\">mentalité</span>.<sup>xxi</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The Type 3 verse for September (above) is a case in point—it records a metaphorical commonplace that seems to have been popular from at least the late sixteenth century, when Nashe referred in his <span class=\"italic\">Prognostication</span> (1591) to <span class=\"italic\">Plentie of poutes to bee had in all places, especiallie in those coastes and Countries where weomen haue not their owne willes</span>. The pun on <span class=\"italic\">carp</span> in the September verse will be apparent, but <span class=\"italic\">pout</span> may not be familiar—OED defines the fishy variety as 'a name applied to several kinds of fish, most commonly to the bib or whiting-pout', and <span class=\"italic\">cod</span> at this period was also a common vernacular term for the scrotum.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Compare Lyly's <span class=\"italic\">Endimion</span> (1632), III.iii.126ff.:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Epiton: <span class=\"italic\">Why in marrying Dipsas, shall haue euery day… foure [dishes] fish… Crab, Carpe\n        Lumpe,</span><sup>xxii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">and Powting.</span><br>\n        Samias: <span class=\"italic\">Excellent, for of my word, she is both crabbish, lumpish, and carping.</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">or this from <span class=\"italic\">The Merry Bell-man's Out-Cryes, or, The City's O yes</span> (1655):</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">\n          <span class=\"italic\"> and ye shall hear a Juniper Lecter, in Billings-gate Nonsense, and have a messe of maundring Broath,</span><sup>xxiii</sup> <span class=\"italic\">wih a dish of Carps and Powts</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">By the mid century the jest was being recycled in the popular <span class=\"italic\">Figure of…</span> literature, e.g. in the <span class=\"italic\">Nine sorts of Dishes a lewd wife provides her Husband from The figure of nine</span> (1662):</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        a messe of Mandring broth<br>\n        a wormwood posset<br>\n        a Dish of crabbed faces<br>\n        a panful of Carp<br>\n        a mouthful of pouts… \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-4\">or in the <span class=\"italic\">Seven things some women provide for their Husbands from The Figure of Seaven</span> by 'MP' (1686<sup>xxiv</sup>):</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        1 A mess of maundring broth<br>\n        2 a dish of Powts<br>\n        3 a handfull of Rue<br>\n        4 a Wormwood Posset<br>\n        5 a Pan full of Carp…\n        </p>\n\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Alexander Globe, <cite>Peter Stent, London Printseller</cite>, c.1642-65 (Vancouver, 1985), p. 179, item 76 (aXVI).  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">i.e. OED <span class=\"italic\">sash</span> 1.b, 'A window-frame covered with paper or linen'.

Another interesting detail of the contemporary street-scene is the latticed box attached to the tavern wall: at <span class=\"italic\">lattice</span>, the <span class=\"italic\"></span>Oxford English Dictionary explains: <span class=\"italic\">A window of lattice-work (usually painted red), or a pattern on the shutter or wall imitating this, formerly a common mark of an alehouse or inn</span>. The <span class=\"italic\">Dictionary</span> illustrates this usage with a quotation from Richard Harvey's <span class=\"italic\">Plaine Percevall</span> (1590), and one not inappropriate to our print: <span class=\"italic\">As they which determine upon an Ale bench whether the passenger that passeth by the lettise be a Saint or a Divell</span>.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It was clearly popular, for it appears in Peter Stent's advertisements of 1654 and 1662, and is still listed in his successor John Overton's catalogue of 1673,<sup>ii</sup> yet only the unique impression in the British Museum's Department of Prints & Drawings survives - testimony to the great rarity of such popular material.  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">David Kunzle was the first to point out the likely dependence of <span class=\"italic\">A New yeares guift</span> on a contemporary German sheet, <span class=\"italic\">Ein köstlich gutes bewertes Recept vor die Männer so böse Weiber haben</span> [A precious and valuable prescription for men who have such evil wives], though in the German sheet the process of correction takes nine days; he drives into the wood on Monday, cuts sticks on Tuesday, beats her on Wednesday, and so on.<sup>iii</sup> The English shrew is shown fleeing before a sturdy devil, his pitchfork raised, as he pursues her - into hell, presumably.</p>\n\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">And: i </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">Alexander Globe, <cite>Peter Stent, London Printseller</cite>, c. 1642-65 (Vancouver, 1985), p. 123 (no.*448).  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">D.

According to Paul, on the Last Day will be revealed 'that man of sin ..., the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God'. In the year following publication of the present sheet, one I.P. composed a tract against the Anabaptists entitled, <span class=\"italic\">Anabaptismes mysterie of iniquity unmasked... also wisedomes bountie unmasking the man of sinne</span> (1623), but use of the phrase was a commonplace of Protestant rhetoric, as seen, for instance, in John Rainolds' sermon, <span class=\"italic\">The discovery of the man of sinne: wherein is set forth the changes of Gods church, in her afflictions by his raigne. Consolations by his ruine</span> (1614). Subsequently, in the magnificent engraved frontispiece to 'The Second Tome' of William Prynne's <span class=\"italic\">Exact Chronological Vindication...</span> (1665), St. Paul himself identifies the Pope (depicted here with triple crown falling from his head) as the Man of Sin. <span class=\"italic\">The man of sin: or a discourse of Popery: wherein the numerous and monstrous abominations... of the Romish church are by their own hands exposed...</span> by William Hughes appeared in 1677, and, at the time of the Popish Plots, the motif is pressed into service yet again, specifically, in the seventh pageant of <span class=\"italic\">The Solemn Mock Procession...</span> (1680), which, according to the 'Explanation' beneath the print, represented 'the Man of Sin himself on a Throne, with his Counsellor the Devil inspiring of him, what new Artifice of cruelty must come next…' </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">The present <span class=\"italic\">Man of Sin</span>, ESTC S96046,   is a magnificent engraved broadside which survives uniquely in Princeton University Library. The <span class=\"italic\">Stationers Register</span> entered it to John Bellamie on 6 July 1622, as <span class=\"italic\">A picture called the Man of sinne revealed or a Map of the kingdome of Antichrist and the Ruyns thereof</span>, and it does indeed bear the imprint, 'Are to be sould by Iohn Bellamie at his shop at the 2 Grey hou[n]ds in Cornehill neer thexchang'. The text is signed 'W.G. scripsit et trans.', who has plausibly been identified as William Gouge, 'arch Puritan preacher at Blackfriars and chronicler of the 1623 Fatal Vespers' (referring to the collapse of a chapel in Blackfriars at which a prominent Jesuit was preaching).   On the other hand, I do not know what W.G. was translating, even though the word must surely imply a foreign original for the whole design.</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">\n           The twenty lettered constituents of the composition are keyed to a verse text, as well as being provided with banderole inscriptions and Biblical references. (For full transcription and commentary, see below.) Figure <span class=\"font-bold\">A</span> is the 'sly impostor' who aspires to tread on Mount Sion (labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">B</span>), on whose summit is a sunburst bearing the Tetragrammaton. He is dressed in 'menstruous rags' according to the caption (or 'polluted clouts', as the verse styles them), carries a crosier, and shields his eyes from the sudden increase in the power of the sun's rays, augmented from a vessel held by an angel (labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">C</span>) despatched from heaven. The excess of light blinds him ('blind this Blinder') and 'shews hid [his] hipocrisies', as with the end of his crosier, figure <span class=\"font-bold\">D</span>, that 'Unerring Man'—used ironically as a satirical glance at the claimed papal infallability—muddies the waters of 'sweet Siloes streaming foard' (which issue from a classical anthropomorphic fountain, also labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">D</span>), and as figure <span class=\"font-bold\">E</span>, forces the laity to drink the 'stir'd dregs'. Figure <span class=\"font-bold\">D</span> is also shown with a church on each shoulder, as is figure <span class=\"font-bold\">F</span>, his 'Abby-lubber Preest', who holds a further two churches in his hands, which he and figure <span class=\"font-bold\">G</span>, 'Gold-linde Simony' (with a church on one shoulder and a bag of money in his left hand),  offer to the large central figure, labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">H</span>.\n         </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-4\">Behind Simony, a simoniac prelate (labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">I</span>) vomits out churches of various sizes that he has previously devoured, and behind him an impressive complex of buildings, labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">K</span>, is presumably intended for the Vatican, from the highest tower of which flutters a banneret inscribed with the Latin and English texts of I Peter 1:24: 'These all must passe, Like flower of Grasse.' Adjacent to it is an equally impressive cathedral labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">L</span>, 'Gods Temple', which a ray from 'Heav'ns jealous Eye' (<span class=\"font-bold\">M</span>) pierces. In the top right hand corner of the sheet, is the Tower of Babel (<span class=\"font-bold\">O</span>) starting to collapse, and in the act of falling from its pinnacle is a naked woman (labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">P</span>) with a goblet in one hand and a mirror in the other, the papal tiara having already fallen from her head; the verse identifies her as 'th'Abominable Whoore', and mentions her 'Cup of Witchcrafts' and her 'Crowne'. Her caption is a verse from Isaiah which alludes to the fall of Babylon, and a recumbent bishop (labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">Q</span>) at the base of the Tower, still holding his church, laments, 'Alas Alas Babilo[n] that great Cit[y]' (Revelation 14:8)—there is no doubt that we are to identify her as the Apocalyptic Whore of Babylon. Despite their differing vowel quality in modern English, 'Babel' and 'Babylon' are the same word (from Hebrew 'babel') and, as the <span class=\"italic\">Oxford English Dictionary</span> notes, the name of the city was also used for 'the mystical Babylon of the Apocalypse; whence, in modern times, [it was] applied polemically to Rome or the papal power'. As the text makes clear, the ruin of Babel/Babylon is also the ruin of 'her Rich lovers', including the 'Emperours, kings and Preests', here labelled R, whose crosiers and sceptres are indeed depicted 'slent' [broken]. The engraver has also shown 'The Chair orturnd', doubtless intended to be the papal throne. </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">\n           To the left, labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">S</span>, is heaven's gate which is guarded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists and from which 'proceede lightening and thunder'; despite the number of churches the bishop (whose crosier falls apart) has brought with him, he and his fellows are shown being repulsed. The palatial Heavenly City, labelled <span class=\"font-bold\">T</span>, is surmounted by another blazing sun bearing the Tetragrammaton. Curiously, placed outside the confines of the City, the 'Redeemed' (labelled V), 'Palmes in their hands', harp and sing in honour of the Deity. <span class=\"font-bold\">A, D,E</span> and the 'Manne' all wear soft squareish caps which are doubtless intended to resemble the type worn by Jesuits.\n         </p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">Several figures in <span class=\"italic\">A Mappe of the Man of Sin</span> are depicted with one or more churches on their shoulders, but this particular motif—the pluralist who holds two or more benefices at the same time—was a recurring and, in fact, quite non-denominational complaint. It is found illustrating the title-pages of two pamphlets issued in 1642, the anonymous <span class=\"italic\">A Purge for Pluralities, shewing the unlawfulnesse of men to have two Livings. Or The Downe-fall of Double Benefices</span>, in which the relatively crude woodcut depicts a minister bearing churches on both shoulders and one in his right hand, and Blaxton's <span class=\"italic\">A remonstrance against the non-residents of great Brittaine</span>, in which the accomplished engraving entitled, <span class=\"italic\">The Carelesse Non-resident</span>, shows a minister bearing a church on his right shoulder and holding another in each hand. In 1681 Samuel Hieron's <span class=\"italic\">The Protestant Mirrour...or, The careful resident, and the careless non-resident</span> was issued in the form of a single-sheet broadside headed by engraved portraits of the two types of clergyman: the 'Carefull Resident' bearing one church on his right shoulder, the 'Careless Non-Resident' having one in each hand and a third on his head. Issued in 1622, the present sheet is the earliest instance of this pluralist motif known to me, unless the puzzling <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/6`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">Doctor Panurgus</router-link> sheet engraved by Martin Droeshout (1601-after 1639) and most recently dated to the 1620s by Antony Griffiths,   is earlier.</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2 font-bold\">A Mappe of the Man of Sin (transcription)</p>\n \n         <p class=\"pb-2\">A Mappe of the Man of Sin: wherin is most lively delineated the Rising Raigning and Ruine of the Kingdome of Antichrist Rising by Pride shutting the Booke of God and imposing Huma[n]e traditions on mens Consciences Raigning by Avarice, Simony, Superstition, Pleasure, and Hipocrisie.

It represents an English view of the settlement between Spain and the States General of Holland, at a time when England and France were negotiating peace between the two parties. F.G. Stephens, who first suggested the plausible date 1609 for the print, noted that 'This Peace [i.e. The Twelve Years Truce] was a severe blow to the Pope, and Maurice [of Nassau, Prince of Orange] was watching the game which promised so much benefit to his country'.<sup>i</sup>    </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Stephens thought <span class=\"italic\">The Revells</span> 'probably of German origin'—a strange attribution, given the Netherlandish context he suggested. In fact, what would appear to be the original model for Cockson's print can now be identified as one bearing the monogram of the Netherlandish engraver Pieter van der Heyden/Petrus a Merica with text in Dutch, which opens <span class=\"italic\">Hola ghy roouers</span>. Harms believes internal evidence suggests a date of issue of between 1598 and 1600,<sup>ii</sup> though I note that in Hind's <span class=\"italic\">History of Engraving</span>, Van der Hetden's <span class=\"italic\">floruit</span> is given as 1550-70, though the British Museum database confirms he was active beyond 1584<sup>iii</sup></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          Comparison with his source shows that Cockson has retained the likenesses on the Catholic side (except that he has replaced a Merica's cardinal's hat with a Jesuit's bonnet), but substituted clearly recognisable portraits on the Protestant side: James I of England, Henri IV of France (d.1610), Christian IV of Denmark, and <span class=\"italic\">Grave Maurice</span> of Nassau, Prince of Orange. They are depicted seated round a table playing various games of chance (backgammon, cards and dice) against three Catholic monks who have staked—and lost—a monstrance, a chalice and much coin. In a picturesque aside—not in his original—Cockson has added a dog urinating on the foot of one of the monks.\n        </p>\n \n        <p class=\"pb-2\">How can we be certain of the publication date of this undated print? The portrait of James I is unmistakable, so provides us with a <span class=\"italic\">terminus post quem</span> of 1603. If the seated figure next to him is correctly identified as Henri IV of France, then we have a <span class=\"italic\">terminus ante quem</span> of 1610—in such a context and given the suspected pun on Pax, for the Peace of the Twelve Years Truce, 1609 seems a reasonable guess. The engraving is signed by Cockson whose dates, however, are not helpful (active 1591-1630).</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The bonneted figure behind the Pope is problematic: Stephens implies he is the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand, i.e. the younger son of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria—and he would be an excellent fit, having Austrian, Spanish and Netherlandish connexions—but is, sadly, ruled out of court by chronology, being born in 1609! The verses, however, describe the standing figure beside the Pope as both a cardinal and an Austrian… perhaps some reader can enlighten me as to his identification? </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The English verse styles the monstrance on the table a <span class=\"italic\">pax</span>, for the benefit, I suggest, of the pun on the <span class=\"italic\">Peace</span> or Truce, which is the real subject of the conference at the table. The verse writer has done his best to wring several such puns out of the composition (see below for full transcription of text): e.g. in their card game, <span class=\"italic\">the Monck could show France nothing but the Knave</span>. The verses explicitly state that Henri is playing maw, a game we are no longer familiar with (and was perhaps only known in the British Isles?), but close comparison with the cards of his source, shows that Cockson has made some subtle alterations to his original—for the card shown face-up on the top of the deck on the table is not Van der Heyden's Ten of Hearts, but the five of that suit, and as hearts are trumps, it is the five of trumps, a special card in the game of maw known by the term 'five finger' (see verse). Furthermore, in Cockson's version, the two uppermost cards in the monk's hand, as if he is about to play one of them, are the Knaves of Diamonds and Hearts (in Van der Heyden's original, they are the Seven of Diamonds and King of Hearts), while his opponent, Henri IV, is already flourishing the Ace of Hearts.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          Not all the rules of maw have come down to us, though we do have a single sheet of <span class=\"italic\">The Groome-porters lawes at Mawe, to be observed in fulfilling the due orders of the game</span> (c.1600) which prints sixteen rules, though—there being no mention of the <span class=\"italic\">five-finger</span>, for instance—there must surely have been further sheets which have not survived. Two of the extant sixteen <span class=\"italic\">lawes</span>, however, concern the <span class=\"italic\"></span>Ace of Hartes, which clearly played a significant role in the game - whichever suit was trumps, cf. <span class=\"italic\">Like the ace of hearts at Mawe</span> in <span class=\"italic\">History of Pope Joan</span> (1599).<sup>iv</sup> By good fortune, however, we learn from <span class=\"italic\">Greene's Newes from Heaven & Hell</span> (1593) that, <span class=\"italic\">Although the knave of trumpes be the seconde carde at Mawe, yet the five-finger may commaunde both him and all the rest of the pack</span>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          If I understand - or, rather, infer - the rules of the game correctly, the three highest value cards in the game were thus — in descending order — Five of Trump Suit, Knave of Trump Suit, Ace of Trump Suit, and thus—in the present context - Five of Hearts, Knave of Hearts, Ace of Hearts. France has cut the pack and 'shown' the Five of Hearts, and as Hearts are trumps, this is the unbeatable <span class=\"italic\">Five Finger</span> — horribly frustrating for the Monk who has what is the second-highest card possible, the Knave of Trumps (Hearts) in his hand! Henry also holds (and shows) the third-highest card, the Ace of Trumps (Hearts).\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          Here is the relevant portion of the verse caption to our sheet:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          ... France setts gould,<br>\n          & shuffles: the Monk cutts: but France (being bould)<br>\n          Deales freely: Rubs : and the first card hee showes,<br>\n          is the Five Finger, which being tourn'd up, goes<br>\n          Cold to the Moncks hart : the next card, France sees<br>\n          in his owne hand, is the Ace of hartes, \"I Leeze\"<br>\n          Cryes out the Monck; sayes France, \"Show what you have,\"<br>\n          the Monck could show France nothing but the Knave.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">(For full text of the verses, see below.)</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">In a reversed copy of the present sheet, dated conjecturally '1626' (by Stephens<sup>v</sup>), and which bears no engraver's signature nor other imprint information, but keeps the urinating dog and the verses (except for necessary changes in the names of the participants as noted below), the cardinal—wearing the characteristic broad-brimmed hat now, not the bonnet—may represent Richelieu (despite the verses which remain unchanged and still mention <span class=\"italic\">Austria</span>), the English king James I (d.1625) is replaced by Charles I, Henri IV of France (d.1610) by Christian IV of Denmark, and Christian IV of Denmark of the earlier version by Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden (1611-1632), while the Transylvanian war-leader Bethlen Gabor replaces Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange (d.1625). What can we say for certain about the date of this later version? The unmistakable likeness of the youthful crowned Charles I replacing James, provides a <span class=\"italic\">terminus post quem</span> of 1625, and the distinctive profile head of Bethlen Gabor provides the <span class=\"italic\">terminus ante quem</span>, as he died in 1629.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Curiously, the engraver of this later, reversed image seems to have reverted to the cards of the original van der Heyden version, i.e. the card turned up on the table is certainly the Ten of Hearts, and the cards in the monk's hand are the Five(?) of Diamonds, and a court card—this, of course, makes a nonsense of the details of the game of maw as given below the image, which remain the same as in Cockson's version, but for the substitution of <span class=\"italic\">Denmarke </span>for <span class=\"italic\">France</span> in the relevant stanza.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Interestingly it is the impression of this later version of the composition (in the Society of Antiquaries collection; another impression is in the Department of Prints & Drawings of the British Museum) which is the subject of what must be one of the earliest journal articles to concern a print, <span class=\"italic\">A Political Caricature, temp. Charles I</span>, in <span class=\"italic\">The Gentleman's Magazine</span> of July 1853. A similarly reversed copy of Van der Heyden's original composition, which I have not seen, was issued in Germany in 1633.<sup>vi</sup></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It seems as though an even later version was published c.1660 - if we can believe the estimate of the cataloguer on whose telegraphic description we are dependent.<sup>vii</sup> It bears the same title but now the verses are disposed in five columns and the revellers presumably updated to reflect the political circumstances of a later seventeenth-century Europe. No imprint is mentioned, so we may assume there is none.  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic font-bold\">The Revells of Christendome</span> (1609)</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Greate Brittaine with proud Rome at Tables playes,<br>\n        Rome looseth every Stake that downe shee layes,<br>\n        yett fretts and sweares to win all, tho' shee pawne<br>\n        her Relliques. thos shee setts, & thos are drawne.<br>\n        The last Stake is the Pax : Greate Brittaines hand<br>\n        is drawing that too: the Pope who by doth stand<br>\n        With Austria, boath beeing Bettors on Romes side,<br>\n        holds fast the Pax: twas gamesters law they cryed<br>\n        To Snatch the last Stake up, Brittaine, then swore<br>\n        to have the Triple Crowne, Romes Vicar wore,<br>\n        The Card'nall quarrells (in defence of Rome)<br>\n        and (beeing Arm'd) trobleth all Christendome.<br>\n        <br>\n        France, sitting not far off, and seeing what hand<sup>viii</sup><br>\n        Great Brittaine had, & how Romes losse did stand,<br>\n        Hopes to winn something too, Maw is the game<br>\n        at which hee playes, & Challengeth at the same<br>\n        A Monk, who stakes a Challice : France setts gould,<br>\n        & shuffles: the Monk cutts: but France (being bould)<br>\n        Deales freely: Rubs : and the first card hee showes,<br>\n        is the <span class=\"italic\">Five Finger</span>, which being tourn'd up, goes<br>\n        Cold to the Moncks hart : the next card, France sees<br>\n        in his owne hand, is the <span class=\"italic\">Ace of hartes</span>, \"I Leeze\"<br>\n        Cryes out the Monck; sayes France, \"Show what you have,\"<br>\n        the Monck could show France nothing but the <span class=\"italic\">Knave</span>.<br>\n        <br>\n        Rome, thus being fleied by Brittaine and by France,<br>\n        and knowing that Gamesters winninges are but chance,<br>\n        Ventures to Challenge Denmark : the Dice Come<br>\n        to Denmarkes hand; hee throwes & winnes from Rome<br>\n        All that he playes for; whilst Graue Maurice standes<br>\n        onely to see Faire Play: yett fills his handes<br>\n        By Betting against Rome, Bearing away<br>\n        so mutch, that Rome no more dare Bett or Play.<br>\n        Her Crosses, Crucifixes, Myters, Cowles,<br>\n        and all the Netts, shee throwes out to catch Sowles<br>\n        Rome now hath lost, Shee, that did all desire,<br>\n        is left more bare, then a bald, shaven Frier.<br>\n        <br>\n        Theis Roiall Gamesters thus with Crownes being stor'de<br>\n        and Rome being without Crownes, all roze from Bord:<br>\n        The Reuells breake up, and theire leaves they take,<br>\n        but (first) Inquiry mongst themselues they make,<br>\n        Which of them all, (because All they had won<br>\n        and that the Dice on theire sides onely ron)<br>\n        Had playd but one false Trick; and fownd at last<br>\n        that Rome threw false Dice in, at every cast,<br>\n        For this, shee never blushd, but onely swore,<br>\n        shee would with Thos 4 Gamesters play no more.<br>\n        Whom will shee play with then, yf Dice ron true,<br>\n        at her owne Game, Rome will her selfe undoe.” \n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\">F.G.Stephens, <cite>Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum: Satirical and Personal Subjects</cite>, vol. 1 (London, 1870), pp. 42-4 (BM Sat. 81).

The English print, <span class=\"italic\">The true and perfect forme of the Strange Ship built at Rotterdam Anno 1653</span>, which though unsigned is attributed to Hollar,<sup>i</sup> clearly copies an original engraved by Frederik de Witt and held uniquely in the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam, entitled <span class=\"italic\">Perfecte Afbeeldinge: van 't Wonderlycke Schip, gemaakt tot Rotterdam</span>. 1653.<sup>ii</sup> Comparison of the texts of the English and Dutch versions is revealing. The original claims that the wonderful ship could reach the East Indies in six weeks, and in a single day get to France and back—on the English sheet this latter claim has been significantly altered to read, '[She] can goe from Rotterdam to London and back againe in one day', and is immediately preceded by the ominous 'the inventor doeth undertake in one day to destroy a honderd Ships'. The message was clear—here is a dastardly secret weapon that the Dutch are about to unleash on English shipping! But the English need not have worried, for, in the event, the vessel never saw action, as De Son was unable to find a clockwork motor powerful enough to drive its internal paddle-wheel.  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The accompanying text is as follows:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        'The true & perfect forme of the Strange Shipp built at Rotterdam Anno 1653[;] the inventor of it doeth undertake in one day to destroy one honderd Ships, can goe from Rotterdam to London and back againe in one day: & in 6 Weekes to goe to the East Indiens, and to run as Swift as a bird can fly[:] no fire, nor Storme or Bullets can hinder her unlesse it please God, Although the Ships meane to bee safe in their havens, it is in vaine. for shee shall come to them in any place, it is impossible for her to bee taken, unlesse by treacherie, and then can not bee governed by any but himselfe, the length is 72, the height is 12 foote, the breadth 8 foote, 1.

As the title makes clear, the text satirises the dandified members of the troop of horse raised in the service of the King by the poet, Sir John Suckling. The two quatrains which caption the inset engraving clearly, and appropriately, poke fun at the habit of smoking:  </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n      Much meate doth gluttony produce.<br>\n      And make a man a swine -- <br>\n      But hee's a temperate man indeed<br>\n      That with a leafe can dine -<br>\n      Hee needes no napkin for his handes<br>\n      His fingers for to wipe<br>\n      Hee hath his kitchen in a box,<br>\n      His Roast meate in a pipe.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n      All the more strange, therefore, that there is no mention of smoking in the lengthy text! The text is a preacher's harangue against such 'Prodigal Sons' as waste their substance—through drinking in the main, and all the attendant vices that drunken rioting leads to. It would appear that the printer has pressed into service an originally mildly amusing, almost cartoon-like, swipe at smokers, to illustrate Suckling's dissipated cavaliers. In fact, the English plate copies very closely (though in reverse) an engraving made c.1630 by Abraham Bosse (after Jean de Saint-Igny) known as <span class=\"italic\">Les Fumeurs</span><sup>ii</sup> captioned with a single quatrain: \n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n      Quand nous sommes remplis d'humeur melancolique<br>\n      La vapeur du Tabac rauiue noz espris;<br>\n      Lors de nouuelle ardeur entierement surpris,<br>\n      Nous veincrions le Dieu Mars en sa fureur bellique.\n      </p> \n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n      [When we are filled with the melancholy humour<br>\n      The vapour of tobacco revives our spirits;<br>\n      Then, entirely surprised by a new ardour,<br>\n      We could vanquish the god Mars in his warlike fury]\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">The importance of this particular, uniquely surviving print—as so many English prints of this era are—is twofold: firstly it shows, yet again, dependence on a foreign model, and secondly, it shows how very ready contemporary English print-publishers were to shoe-horn into their money-spinning prints anything vaguely appropriate, in order to seize a commercial opportunity while the subject was still topical (a practice very familiar from the woodcut illustrations to broadside ballads). What it is not, <span class=\"italic\">pace</span> F.G. Stephens et al., is a satire of Sucklington—it is a satire of the contemporary cavalier dandy (See <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/9`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">Funeral Obsequies</router-link>), and not even an English one!</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">A transcription of the letterpress text follows:</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2 font-bold\">THE SVCKLINGTON FACTION: OR ( SUCKLINGS ) Roaring Boyes.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">Here sits the prodigall Children, the younger brothers (<span class=\"italic\">Luk.</span> 15.12.) acting the parts of hot-spur Cavaliers and disguised ding-thrifts, habiting themselves after the fashions of the world, as one that is to travaile into a farre Countrey. <span class=\"italic\">Nisi hominibus placuerit Deus, non erit eorum, Deus</span>. Because his father humors him not, with the Idolatrous Ceremonies to follow Popish Innovations, he becomes an errand Peripateticke, flying in a dudgeon and discontent from Gods household, and consequently from the Almighties direction and protection. Not having God for his guide, hee hath the Devill for his conducter, walking now not only after the lusts of the flesh, and of his mind, fulfilling the desires of both; but after the Prince of the ayre, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.<sup>iii</sup>  With the debaucht Gallants of these lascivious and loose-living times, he drawes his Patrimony through his throat, bequeathing the creatures to consumption for consummation of his intemperate voracity, delicate luxury, and wastfull prodigality, spending all either upon his belly or his backe, following the proud, apish, anticke, and disguised fashions of the times, to present himselfe a painted Puppet on the stage of vanity.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\"><span class=\"italic\">Alia</span> [sic], <span class=\"italic\">vina, Venus, tribus his sum factus egenus</span><sup>iv</sup>  </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">What with wine and women, horses, hounds, and whores, dauncing, dicing, drabbing, drinking, may the prodigall man say: I am brought unto a morsel of bread, yea unto the very huskes of Swine.<sup>v</sup> Pride of spirit makes him to scorne an Alehouse, and therefore with greater eagernesse hee daily haunts Tavernes: where sometimes he sits by his liquor, and bloud of the Vine, and the spirits of the Celler, exhausting, and infusing them unto mad ebriety: thus drinking <span class=\"italic\">ad modum sine mensura</span>,<sup>vi</sup> whole ones, by measure, without measure, like the Elephant through the juice of Mulberries, he is enraged unto bloud, and most damnable resolutions and designes, terminated in the death and destruction of the next man he meetes, that never did, neither thought him harme.

One such is <span class=\"italic\"></span>Syons Calamitye or Englands Miserye Hieroglyphically Delineated (1643). This is one of the most interesting prints of the era, anonymously engraved, with text presumed to be by the otherwise unknown A. Jackman (who signs the dedication to the Earl of Northumberland<sup>i</sup>), and sold by the otherwise unknown Nathaniel Gilby. This fascinating symbolic depiction of the state of the nation survives in just two impressions, but deserves to be much better known, and thus merits a detailed description.  </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The Eye of Providence gazes down on King Charles and Law (a long-haired woman), kneeling in prayer, their upraised hands joined by a chain which passes through the crown and sceptre. In the centre of the plate is a rectangular enclosure in which two armies fight, and England (accompanied by Conscience and Justice) is trammelled within a <span class=\"italic\">strong Compacted Nett</span>, held tight by evil councillors, and from which a bare-breasted Astrea (the spirit of Elizabeth I?) with sword upraised endeavours to free them. A philosopher advises King Charles to submit himself to Reason and to the <span class=\"italic\">evill Crewe / Of wicked Counsellors declare theire dew</span>. With the gate to the enclosure defended by War, however, two bands led by Peace (with an olive branch) and Truth (holding a solar disc) are excluded, as are the commoners praying for the King, Church, Law and State. On either side of this central axis are three sections. The middle sections on either side represent the radically differing states of Ireland and Scotland, the former lamenting the war, murder, executions, and burnings by which she is surrounded, the latter curiously depicted as benefiting from the general confusion obtaining in England in two metaphorical vignettes: in one a Scotswoman picks up coins from the ground, saying, <span class=\"italic\">Oh yow shall have dainty twopences</span>, while another sifts corn and says, <span class=\"italic\">The wheat for me the chaffe for thee</span>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        In the top righthand section we find Judgement and Reason chained to a post, while Passion in armour and a snake-haired Fury run amok, the former with sword and dagger in hand yelling, <span class=\"italic\">Kill</span>, the latter carrying a flaming torch and shrieking, <span class=\"italic\">Fire</span>. In another vignette a pair of asses pull Misery in a carriage of state, as a figure (identified as Famine in the text) runs past, and a skeleton (identified as Fate) with hourglass and dart in hand runs behind the carriage. Another pair of asses has collapsed under the weight of their burdens (labelled <span class=\"italic\">Honores</span>) while a man representing the Commons attempts to hold them up, and another man holding a document says, <span class=\"italic\">No Monopolies I beseech yow</span>, alluding to what had long been a bone of contention between Crown and Parliament.\n      </p> \n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n      The bottom righthand section, entitled <span class=\"italic\">Phantasia Triumphans</span>, contains some most interesting miniature scenes evidently aimed at the sectaries of the day. A couple wearing crowns, but otherwise normally dressed, exclaim, <span class=\"italic\">I shall be Kinge of Jerusalem</span> and <span class=\"italic\">and I Queene</span>. Another man, labelled a <span class=\"italic\">Vomere ad Rostra</span> [from the plough to the pulpit], with his index finger pointing heavenwards, says, <span class=\"italic\">I am the Prophett sent</span>, a third in Puritan dress declares, <span class=\"italic\">Ther's nothing to oppose us</span>, a fourth in Cavalier garb smoking a pipe, <span class=\"italic\">All's our owne</span>, a fifth, <span class=\"italic\">I Speake all extempore nonsence naturally</span>, while a group of four boys announces, <span class=\"italic\">we are wiser then our Teachers</span> [Psalm 119.99]. A 'holier-than-thou' woman, perhaps intended as a Quaker, says to the smoking Cavalier, <span class=\"italic\">Stand further of &c</span>, with a reference to Isaiah 65.5: <span class=\"italic\"></span>Stand by thyself, come not near me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose... A final odd couple are a man (perhaps a divine) dressed in black holding a book who says, <span class=\"italic\">Tu Sans Ratione Philautos</span> [Self-love, thou art without reason], to a plainly-dressed man holding an andiron on whose shoulder he places his hand. This curious attribute also appears in the hand of the man excreted by the Devil in the woodcut illustrating the title-page to <span class=\"italic\">A Reply As True As Steele</span> (1641), John Taylor's attack on the 'mechanick' preacher Henry Walker, an ironmonger by trade. The present scene on the print is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Hinc illæ lachrimæ</span>, a quotation from Terence, literally meaning 'hence those tears', and used to refer to the real, underlying cause of a person's malaise. But the print designer has also added a reference to the third and fourth chapters of Paul's Second Epistle to Timothy. The second verse of the former chapter refers to the circumstances which will obtain <span class=\"italic\">in the last days</span>, specifically, that <span class=\"italic\">men shall be lovers of their own selves</span>, while in verse 14 of the latter chapter Paul remembers <span class=\"italic\">Alexander the coppersmith</span> [who] <span class=\"italic\">did me much evil</span>—perhaps another oblique reference to Walker's profession.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">In the top lefthand section of the design, the Church (labelled <span class=\"italic\">Ecclesia Languens</span>) is flanked by sincere but ineffectual Protestant divines who are opposed by Catholic and Laudian bishops labelled <span class=\"italic\">Susorrores</span> (literally, 'whisperers', but rendered 'politicians' in the accompanying verse text) and <span class=\"italic\">Adulatores</span> [flatterers].<sup>ii</sup> Four young students cast away their books (captioned <span class=\"italic\">Victa jacet pietas</span> from Ovid's <span class=\"italic\">Metamorphoses</span>—'piety, defeated, lies dead'), and point admiringly at three armed Cavaliers. A final scene of two men labelled <span class=\"italic\">Inconcionatores</span> [sic], referred to in the text as <span class=\"italic\">Dunces</span>, appears to show a beadle (?) whipping a barefoot friar (his rosary hanging from his girdle) out of town; the latter exclaims <span class=\"italic\">Væ mihi</span> [woe is me], but the pair are also captioned, <span class=\"italic\">Nihil refert ad nos</span> [Nothing matters to us].</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">The lower lefthand section, entitled <span class=\"italic\">Lex Subjecta</span>, comprises a number of scenes to do with the exercise of the Law in the years immediately preceding publication of the print. Curiously, F.G. Stephens in his Victorian description of it, contented himself with describing the main scene as 'judges with ships and laurel wreaths upon their heads sitting neglected'—judges with ships on their heads?<sup>iii</sup> Either he did not feel this required explanation or—if I dare suggest it of this scholar, for whom I have the greatest admiration—he simply did not recognise the significance! He neglected to point out that the two of the six judges wearing laurel wreaths are trampling on ships, while the other four wearing the ship 'hats' are trampling on their laurels, nor did he refer to the two men beside the bench, one of whom similarly wears a ship on his head and drags behind him a large purse bearing the royal arms. He says, <span class=\"italic\">Heu quanta de spe decidam</span> [Alas! from what a height of hope I will fall], to which his companion responds reassuringly, <span class=\"italic\">Ne timeas</span> [Have no fear], but the purse is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Hinc petitio et Perditio hujus</span> [From this place comes the writ and his ruin]. This must surely allude to the notorious Ship Money tax levied by Charles from 1635 onwards until abolished by statute in 1641. In 1637 John Hampden, the Buckinghamshire MP, brought a test case to court by refusing to pay the levy (the ostensible purpose of which was to finance the refitting of the navy); the judges were divided on the legality of the measure, though eventually a majority found in favour of the King on this occasion. Designed after the 1641 abolition, the minority of the bench who trample the ships, labelled <span class=\"italic\">Memoria justi vivet in Æternum</span> [The memory of the just will live eternally] are clearly 'the good guys', the others being labelled <span class=\"italic\">Obliti sumus Parliamenti</span> [We were oblivious of parliament]. The accompanying verse text (perhaps tactfully) glosses over this particular topical and historic case, preferring to refer in much more general terms to the fact that <span class=\"italic\">The Lawes... have bene abused, and the Lawe / Pul'd downe Injustice Raisd....</span> Another scene shows a panel of four unjust judges jeering at the plaintiff who kneels before them, saying</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n      Our Canon<sup>iv</sup> <br>\n      So shall he know<br>\n      Choake him with an &c<br>\n      The knav's wittie\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">Two further scenes feature men wearing fools' caps: one, saying <span class=\"italic\">Te flectere faciam</span> [I will make you bend], enacts the proverbial folly of trying to bend a stone pillar, which is itself labelled <span class=\"italic\">cunctis eadem </span>(from the Vulgate text of Ecclesiastes 9.3; in the KJV: 'This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all', i.e. death), while the other fool kicks and whips a dishevelled woman representing Conscience, who exclaims, <span class=\"italic\">Est ne Deus</span> [Is there no God].<sup>v</sup> There is also a well with two men in buckets, one rising as the other descends; the man in the ascendancy says, <span class=\"italic\">Hodie mihi cras tibi</span> [Me today, you tomorrow]—a tag more usually found as a <span class=\"italic\">memento mori</span>—while the other says, <span class=\"italic\"></span>Tempora mutantur [Times change]. Lastly, in the four corners of the engraving, four foreign rivals are depicted, gloating over the opportunities this chaos in England affords their respective countries. Their four labels form a quatrain, and they are also assigned mottoes as follows:</p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n      The Lord Dane cries if these hold I'le be cheefe<br>\n      Redditum expecto [I expect to be restored]<br>\n      The Hungrie Spaniard wisheth its good Befe<sup>vi</sup> <br>\n      Valde Esurio [I desire it very much]<br>\n      The smooth Tongu'd Frenchman sayes Oh! that's for me<br>\n      Ista mihi [That's for me]<br>\n      The Dutch man bids, hands of; that shall not be.<br>\n      Non aude sed time [Do not dare but fear]\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">At the bottom are three columns of verses keyed by letter to the various scenes in the print, and providing a commentary on them. </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        These are as follows:\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"pb-2\">\n      <span class=\"font-bold\">A</span> Alas Poore England! how art thou Distrest<br>\n      With Warre? which for a longe time was soe blest<br>\n      With Peace: that all thy Neighbouringe Nations<br>\n      Admir'de thy Glorye when all their Stations<br>\n      Were even fild with bloodye warres and strife<br>\n      Then did thy Children Live a Peacefull life.<br>\n      <span class=\"font-bold\">B</span> What?

Though sadly not known to be extant, we can be certain that the image in question was neither of some particularly famous retainer, nor an idealised 'real' human servant, but the earliest-known English representative of the composite pictorial figure of the <span class=\"italic\">Ideal Servant</span> who is given various animal characteristics appropriate to his duties.  </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        John Hoskins' verses accompanying the Winchester College mural (see below) declare that the pig's snout signifies that the Ideal Servant will not be fussy about what he eats, the ass's ears, that he will bear his master's rages with patience, and the stag's feet, that he will be swift to carry out his errands (The padlocked lips, which indicate that he knows how to keep his master's secrets, while not of animal origin, are also a significant attribute, of course, but there is not space to explore this motif fully here). Only a very few years after the date of this entry in the <span class=\"italic\">Registers</span>, in the early 1580s, and while still a school-boy, the future sergeant-at-law, John Hoskins, caused just such a figure to be painted on the wall outside the kitchens of Winchester College and subscribed descriptive verses of his own devising. The earliest copy of this famous and still extant image appears in a manuscript dated 1647 entitled <span class=\"italic\">Schola Wichamica</span> in the Fellows' Library of Winchester College, drawn by Robert Mathew and entitled EFFIGIES SERVI COLLEGIATI (although, by this date, we know it had already been repainted three times).<sup>i</sup>  The young John Hoskins is known to have had an uncle named William of the same period as the London publisher (above), so that it is at least theoretically possible that it was he who provided his nephew with the original design.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        As so often, the device is not an original English invention.<sup>ii</sup> The great early print-collector, Ferdinand Columbus had already obtained two prints of this allegorical figure for his collection before his death in 1539, and Gilbert Cousin described this exemplary composite  the French had painted in their houses in his [<span class=\"italic\">Oiketes sive</span>] <span class=\"italic\">De Officio Famulorum</span> (Basel, 1535) - the details of which would have been known to the English via Thomas Chaloner's 1543 translation. A woodcut representation appeared in Dinckel's German translation of Cousin's book published in Erfurt in 1583, and on the cover of an edition issued in the same city a decade later where the woodcut image is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Biltnis eines frommen Knechts</span> [portrait of a pious servant]. A French image contemporary with the <span class=\"italic\"></span>Stationers Register entry does survive as a woodcut sheet, entitled <span class=\"italic\">Le Bon Serviteur</span>, in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris,<sup>iii</sup> and it is highly likely that the Serving Man listed in Thomas Jenner's advertisement of 1662 represented the same personage. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        As things stand, however, an engraving dated 1682 and entitled <span class=\"italic\">This Ages Rarity: or The Emblem of a Good Servant Explain'd</span>, is the earliest English example to survive.<sup>iv</sup>  The verse beneath explains the curious image:\n        </p> \n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Hinds Feet he hath, to shew how nimble he<br>\n        In the Dispatch of Business ought to be:<br>\n        His Asses Ears and Muzzel'd Mouth do show<br>\n        He should be swift to Hear, but to Speak slow.<br>\n        His Meagre Look, and his Thin Panch,<sup>v</sup> declare,<br>\n        That he should be content with slender Fare.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">But the motif is in fact, to be found earlier - though somewhat disguised - on two closely-related sheets, issued in 1641, one etched, one woodcut: Hollar's symbolic <span class=\"italic\">Picture of a Pattenty</span> [i.e. Patentee], and a broadside with verses by John Taylor the Water Poet, entitled, <span class=\"italic\">The Complaint of M. Tenter-hooke the Projector, and Sir Thomas Dodger the Patentee</span>, the woodcut to which - specifically, the portrait of Mr. Tenterhooke - is clearly based on Hollar's engraving. M. Dorothy George noted that in 1641 Monopolies officially ceased, and it is this historical fact that enables us to infer the date of both prints. She continues:.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">'It is a striking example of the application to politics of the folk-print in which persons are constructed of objects connected with their calling. A man with a wolf's head has fish-hook fingers which pull strings attached to money bags; his legs are screws. The rest of the body is made up of things that had been the subjects of monopoly: wine, playing-cards, coals, soap, pins, &c.<sup>vi</sup></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Another English print example of this sort of Arcimboldesque composite portrait is <router-link :to=\"`/printsInFocusView/12`\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline\">A Jesuit Displaid</router-link> (c.1682).\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The <span class=\"italic\">Picture of a Pattenty</span> is not signed by Hollar, but has long been quite reasonably attributed to him on purely stylistic grounds, and there is no reason not to think it his. That he was the inventor, however, can now be shown not to be the case, for what is clearly the same figure had already appeared some fifty years earlier in a series of eight engravings entitled <span class=\"italic\">Litis Abusus</span> [the Abuse of Litigation], signed in the second state, <span class=\"italic\">H[endrik]G[oltzius] fecit</span>, and dated 1597.<sup>vii</sup> </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        In this series the figure in question is labelled <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span> (in the Dutch caption rendered as Proces), i.e. Litigation, and he appears most clearly in the third print of the series, given the editorial title, <span class=\"italic\">Avarice</span> is the root of all evil [Timothy 6.10, <span class=\"italic\">Radix enim omnium malorum est cupiditas</span>, is quoted on the sheet]. It depicts a blindfold Cupid followed by <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span> whose 'hands' are held by <span class=\"italic\">Opinio</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Testamenta</span> (with skull-head and a forged will for hat), with <span class=\"italic\">Meum</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Tuum</span> bringing up the rear (“A popular phrase to express the rights of property,” as OED succinctly defines the phrase <span class=\"italic\">meum and tuum</span>). <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span> wears doublet and hose and has a wolf's head; in place of legs and feet he stands on a pair of screws, and his hands are replaced by triple hooks. Where his chest should be is an open lion's maw.<sup>viii</sup> The symbolism of <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span>'s make-up is nowhere explained, but in the fifth print of the series we see him seated on a throne devouring the homestead of a man labelled <span class=\"italic\">Litigator</span> (which he is feeding the monster), while from the lion's maw in his chest, <span class=\"italic\"></span>Lis vomits miniature versions of himself labelled <span class=\"italic\"></span>Lis lites generans [Litigation begets lawsuits]. To the right of <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span>'s throne are two female figures with appropriate attributes labelled <span class=\"italic\">Negligentia domus</span> [Neglect of house] and <span class=\"italic\">Negligentia temporis</span> [Neglect of time], and a third female, <span class=\"italic\">Negligentia animae</span> [Neglect of soul], who hangs the soul of the litigant over a rack. A miniature version of <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span> appears in the final print of the series flying in on demonic wings to receive the soul of the dying and now destitute litigant.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Hollar clearly adapted the figure of <span class=\"italic\">Lis</span> as portrayed in this late sixteenth-century series for his <span class=\"italic\">Picture of a Pattenty</span> of 1641. Curiously, Hollar's caption both alludes to the figure's <span class=\"italic\">Hogshead</span> and terms it a <span class=\"italic\">Wolfe like devourer of the Common wealth</span> - curious, because the monster has a wolf's rather than a hog's head. The <span class=\"italic\">Hogshead</span> perhaps puns on the liquid measure of that name, a large cask for liquor, but though Taylor's text alludes to the monopoly on wine, the verses to the Hollar engraving do not: here, by implication, it is left to a flagon labelled <span class=\"italic\">Wine P</span>.[atent] on the figure's sleeve. It is even posible that hogshead is a mistake for oxhead (see below). Playing upon the familiar proverb All is fish that comes to net,<sup>ix</sup> the caption's <span class=\"italic\">All[']s Fish comes to his hooke</span> refers the reader back to the hooks in place of fingers on the creature's hands. With a deceptively modern ring to it,<sup>x</sup> the final exultant couplet reads: </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Strong scrues support him that hath scru'd us all,<br>\n        And now we live, to see this strong man fall.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          There is nothing porcine about either Hollar's figure or that illustrating Taylor's broadside, so it is again surprising to read the latter's verses describing the woodcut <span class=\"italic\">M. Tenter-hooke</span>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        For you (as in my Picture plain appeares)<br>\n        I put a Swines face on, an Asses eares,<br>\n        The one to listen unto all I heard<br>\n        Wherein your worships profit was prefer'd.<sup>xi</sup><br>  \n        The other to tast all things, good or bad<br>\n        (As Hogs will doe) where profit may be had.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Taylor must here be thinking of the motif of the <span class=\"italic\">Trusty Servant</span>, as in the Winchester College mural (above) and the lost print entered in the <span class=\"italic\">Stationers Register</span> in 1577. Indeed, the Water Poet had made use of the same commonplace in one of his poems some years earlier,<sup>xii</sup> and the present verses make it clear that he sees <span class=\"italic\">M. Tenter-hooke the Projector</span> as the servant of <span class=\"italic\">Sir Thomas Dodger the Patentee—What was I but your journey-man?</span></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The animal qualities appropriate to the Ideal or Trusty Servant became variously distributed over time.

Douce began assembling his print collection in order to provide authentic, contemporary illustrations for the socio-historical works he compiled, most notably his <span class=\"italic\">Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of ancient manners: with dissertations on the clowns and fools of Shakespeare; on the collection of popular tales entitled Gesta Romanorum; and on the English Morris Dance</span>, first published in 1807. Though this enormous collection still awaits adequate cataloguing, already a number of significant unique English print items have been discovered within it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The present sheet - one of several English prints which survive uniquely in the Douce Collection -  is a very close copy in reverse of an untitled engraving by the unidentified C.I., published in Amsterdam by Hugo Allard the Elder c.1650.<sup>i</sup>  Our English sheet is entitled <span class=\"italic\">This Costly Fish Catcht In's Weil/ All These Desire To Tast As Wel As Feele. at All times in Season.</span> A weil is a wicker trap for catching fish, especially eels,<sup>ii</sup> and in the Dutch original the naked woman in the weel is referred to as an eel or little eel. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        On the bank of a river we see a naked young woman caught in what looks like a long, hooped net. It appears from the text that the fisherman who is pulling on the ropes attached to the net has just found this strange 'fish' in his net. Behind him - forming a sort of queue - are a monk, a gallant/Cavalier, a lawyer and an old man on crutches - again it appears from the text that each is eager to acquire the fisherman's catch. Standing in the fisherman's boat beside the net is another rather dumpy and fully-clothed young woman offering the fisherman a knife and urging him to cut the rope with it and throw his catch back, in order that the men should turn their attention to her - thus, implicit criticism of female jealousy is added to that of male lasciviousness.\n        </p> \n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The unidentified Dutch engraver, C.I., has expanded somewhat the design of a very popular plate in the influential <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus Facetiarum</span> (Strasbourg, 1608, 1618, 1643, etc.) which shows a man (the fisherman) pulling the foot of the woman in the eel-pot, while a soldier, a monk (or priest?) and an old man on crutches look on. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"> The verses under the image present the reactions of the various figures to their surprising catch. The full text is as follows:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        A [Fisherman, Peter]<br>\n        <br> \n        Poter [<span class=\"italic\">sic</span>: i.e., Peter] in's Weil by chance did light<br>\n        Vpon a Mayd with Belly white.<br>\n        Hee drew full hard, and layd about,<br>\n        With all his force, to get her out<br>\n        This Fish was such a goodly sight,<br>\n        Hee longed for it, with delight.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        B [Monk, Father Steven]<br>\n        <br> \n        Father Steven who stood by<br>\n        His hands out from's sleeves, did cry,<br>\n        Pull hard Peeter this present,<br>\n        Let mee have to my Co[n]vent.<br>\n        Doe so go, and make all even,<br>\n        All thy sins shall be forgiven.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        C [Soldier, Robert the Cavalier]<br>\n        <br> \n        Young Robert, to get such spoil,<br>\n        His blood within his veins did boyl.<br>\n        With gold that he had filld his purse,<br>\n        All for this he will disburse.<br>\n        Peter said he you are Old,<br>\n        Heeres coin, go Drink, keep out ye cold.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        D [Doll]<br>\n        <br> \n        Doll heard what each man said,<br>\n        She vext, and was half dismaid,<br>\n        Hold, she cried tis time I think<br>\n        To cut the cord; let her sink.<br>\n        You all strive to set her free,<br>\n        Not one of you will pull for mee.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        E [Lawyer]<br>\n        <br> \n        The learned Lawer he intends,<br>\n        And for her, pleads, thus, my friends.<br>\n        Bee not so earnest, for this chere,<br>\n        In time may cost you all full deare.<br>\n        It hath cost me pounds and pence,<br>\n        Tis costly fare, with great expence.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        F [Old Man, Grandsire Hop]<br>\n        <br> \n        Grandsire Hop<sup>iii</sup> said see you mee,<br>\n        That haue scars<sup>iv</sup> one limb left free.<br>\n        With Crutches I can hardly creep,<br>\n        And yet I cannot chuse but peep.<br>\n        The pox and gout wring mee sore,<br>\n        Yet can I not give it ore.<sup>v</sup>  \n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n        <li class=\"py-2\">There is an impression in the British Museum,  1875, 0508. 17 - incipit Pieter ving lest, in zen fuyk       </li>\n        <li class=\"py-2\">OED s.v. weel</li>\n        <li class=\"py-2\">Probably not a satirical name, cf.

By 1560 at the latest, a broadside print had evolved in France, the earliest version of which is entitled <span class=\"italic\">Le Caquet<sup>i</sup> des femmes</span> [The Cackling of Women] which depicts a townscape in which women gossip at the bakery, the bath-house, the laundry, and even in church.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          The English version, <span class=\"italic\">The Severall Places Where you May hear News</span>, is certainly derived from this French original, though far from slavishly, English scenes being occasionally substituted; e.g. the French watermill is replaced by an English market, with wool being weighed and women selling fruit and vegetables, an English ale-house is introduced, and a couple of French beggars are replaced by two women carrying a tub of washing slung from a cowlstaff over their shoulders. In our present sheet, the venues for gossiping are labelled <span class=\"italic\">At the Childbed, At the Market, At the Hottehovse</span> [i.e. Baths], <span class=\"italic\">At the Bakehovse, At the Conditte</span> [i.e. well-head], <span class=\"italic\">At the Ælle Hovs, At the River</span>, and even <span class=\"italic\">At the Chvrch</span> - though it is noticeable that the English artist has silently expunged the recording-demon present in the French original, and replaced the man kneeling before the altar while the priest elevates the host with a minister preaching from a pulpit.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          As the bilingual lexicographer Randle Cotgrave was to point out - with admirable (and anachronistic) 'gender-blindness' - in his <span class=\"italic\">A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</span> (1611), at <span class=\"italic\">four</span> [oven]:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"> <span class=\"italic\">C'est au four, & au moulin, ou l'on sçait des nouvelles: Pro</span> [verb]. <span class=\"italic\">For while the bread bakes, and the corne grinds, people have some leisure to tell how the world goes.</span></p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The contemporary English poet Richard West (fl.1606-19) must surely have had this very sheet in mind when he described the <span class=\"italic\">tatling Gossips</span> thus in <span class=\"italic\">The Court of Conscience, or Dick Whippers Sessions</span> (1607)\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        You that at Conduicts, and such other places,<br>\n        The ale-house, bake-house, or the washing block<br>\n        Meet daily, talking with your brazen faces,<br>\n        Of peoples matters which concerne you not...<sup>ii</sup>  \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          A version of the same composition was etched by Hollar c.1628, and provided with numbers which relate to the verses of a German broadside entitled <span class=\"italic\">Schaw Platz</span>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n          A 17-century impression of this print was collected by Samuel Pepys, when the woodblock was much less worn, but at that date the title was “The Severall Places Where you May hear News”. The British Museum's eighteenth-century impression of the sheet - now entitled <span class=\"italic\">Tittle-Tattle; Or, the several Branches of Gossipping </span>- adds an extra ninth quatrain to the verses below the sheet, the previous verses being the same as in the earlier impression (but for trivial variants), though arranged in a slightly different order. They read as follows:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        At Child-bed when the Gossips meet,<br>\n        Fine Stories we are told:<br>\n        And if they get a Cup too much,<br>\n        Their Tongues they cannot hold.<br>\n        At Market when good Houswives meet,<br>\n        Their Market being done,<br>\n        Together they will crack a Pot,<br>\n        Before they can get Home.<br>\n        The Bake-house is a Place you know<br>\n        Where Maids a Story hold,<br>\n        And if<sup>iii</sup> their Mistresses will prate,<br>\n        They must<sup>iv</sup> not be control'd.<br>\n        At Alehouse you see how jovial they be<br>\n        With every one her Noggin:<sup>v</sup>  <br>\n        For till the Skull and the Belly be full,<br>\n        None of them will be jogging <sup>vi</sup> <br>\n        To Church fine Ladies do resort,<br>\n        New Fashions for to spy:<br>\n        And others go to Church sometimes<br>\n        To shew their Bravery.<sup>vii</sup> <br> \n        The Hot-house makes a rough Skin smooth<br>\n        And doth it beautify:<br>\n        Fine Gossips use it every Week,<br>\n        Their Skins to purify.<br>\n        At the Conduit striving for their Turn,<br>\n        The Quarrell it grows great,<br>\n        That up in Arms they are at last,<br>\n        and one another beat.<br>\n        Washing at the River's Side<br>\n        Good Housewives take Delight:<br>\n        But scolding Sluts care not to work,<br>\n        Like wrangling Queens<sup>viii</sup> they fight.<br>\n        Then Gossips all a Warning take,<br>\n        Pray cease your Tongue to rattle:<br>\n        Go knit, and Sew, and Brew, and Bake,<br>\n        And leave off TITTLE-TATTLE. \n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\"> From a linguistic perspective, I note the metaphorical use in the French title of a term originally appropriate only to <span class=\"italic\">hens</span> - part of the enduring metaphorics which compares human sexual relations to those of the cock and hen [cf. <span class=\"italic\">hen-pecked, hen party, cock of the walk</span>...].

The appearance of the last is not known, but the first is a diagram of text arranged around the “Philosopher's Head” (its alternative title), and the second is an elaborately pictorial scene, of the same type as <span class=\"italic\">An Artificiall Description of Logick</span>, while a further sheet entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Theater of Nature</span> would have been somewhere in between—perhaps we might term it a pictorialised schema. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        What unites all five, however—and in addition, the splendidly pictorial <span class=\"italic\">Tree of Mans Life</span>, engraved by Goddard the following year<sup>iii</sup> - is that a certain Richard Dey is credited with authorship of the texts. He styles himself a Cambridge BA, and so is presumably enrolled amongst the alumni of that university.<sup>iv</sup> The most promising candidate is the Richard Day [sic], a scholar from Eton, who was admitted to King's College in 1622, and graduated BA 1625-6, MA in 1629, and BD in 1637, the year of the earliest-known print signed by Dey. He was a fellow of Kings until 1644, and vicar of Prescot, Lancashire, in 1642, where he died in 1650. He followed his father of the same name at Kings (matriculated 1590), and came from a family of theologians, being the grandson of the William Day (1529-1596), who was successively, Provost of Eton, Dean of Windsor, and Bishop of Winchester. That said, it is odd—if he is, indeed, our man—that he styles himself <span class=\"italic\">in art bacc</span>: on <span class=\"italic\">An Artificiall Description of Logick</span> (late 1637), <span class=\"italic\">in Art: Bacca: Cantabri</span>. on <span class=\"italic\">A Laurel of Metaphisick</span>, entered in the Stationers Registers on 16th January 1638, and as <span class=\"italic\">Batch: in arts</span> on <span class=\"italic\">The Tree of Mans Life</span> (not before 1639), seeing that we know that the above Richard Day was already both MA and Bachelor of Divinity by these dates. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Most of these sheets for which Dey provided text—or, rather, translations—are English versions of prints first issued on the continent, yet again testifying to the currency and availability of foreign models to artists in England. By 1659 at least four of the sheets were available from Robert Walton: <span class=\"italic\">The Philosophers Head, The Laurel of Metaphysic, An Artificial Description of Logic</span> and <span class=\"italic\">The Tree of Mans Life</span>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The present sheet, entitled in full, <span class=\"italic\">The Tree of Mans Life Or an Emblem declareing the like, and unlike, or various condition of all men in their estate of Creation, birth, life, death, buriall, resurrection, and last Judgment, with pyous observations out of the Scriptures upon the severall branches</span> is signed by the engraver John Goddard, and <span class=\"italic\">By Ri Dey Batch: in arts</span>. It has recently been discovered that Goddard was not made free of the Merchant Taylors Company until 1639, which (it is therefore assumed) becomes the earliest possible date for the publication of this print.<sup>v</sup> If this reasoning holds, then it is unlikely to have been occasioned by the wedding in 1634 of Susanna Vernatti, to whom it is fulsomely dedicated: <span class=\"italic\">To the right worshipfull and virtueous Lady the Lady Susanna Vernatti; R:D: wisheth encrease of the best blessings in this life, and fruition of æternall joyand felicitie in the life to come, humbly dedicating his endeavours, and desyreing favourable acceptance of his best services</span>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\"> It is a close copy of the <span class=\"italic\">Arbor Hvmanae Vitae</span> issued [in Antwerp] by Theodoor Galle (d.1633) and doubtless engraved by him too; the credit for its design, however, is given to Nicolaus Christophorus Radziuilus (d.1616). Dey has translated all the Latin inscriptions into English and - as with the contemporary <span class=\"italic\">Artificiall Description of Logick</span> - Goddard has altered it somewhat so as to be acceptable to Protestant eyes, by replacing Galle's Christ in Majesty adored by Mary and the Apostles by the name CHRIST irradiated, and 'airbrushed out' St. Peter's keys.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">The British Museum impression of the sheet - the only other known impression is in the Beinecke Library of Yale University—bears the imprint, <span class=\"italic\">Are to be sould by Ro: Walton at the Globe and Compass in St. Paules church yard betweane the two north dores</span>, but traces of an earlier imprint beneath it are plainly visible, and Griffiths not unreasonably suggests that publisher might have been Thomas Hinde who is known to have published the earlier state of Dey's <span class=\"italic\">Order of the Universe</span> (above), and his <span class=\"italic\">Artificial Description of Logic</span><sup>vi</sup>. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The composition itself takes the form of a massive tree, on the roots and branches of which are inscribed Biblical texts. At the crown of the tree is the irradiated name of Christ. The trunk of the tree divides to accommodate two inset scenes, Dives and Lazarus (B) below, and Death with his scythe, a funeral and burial behind him (D), above. Two further scenes are inset bottom left—a woman with a baby on her knee—and bottom right—a woman breast-feeding a swaddled infant in a bedchamber.<sup>vii</sup>     \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Six stages of the tree are labelled A-F from the bottom upwards; they are keyed to six lines printed at the bottom of the sheet: \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        A <span class=\"italic\">Wee are all borne alike, and equall being in our infancie, contented with milke</span><br>\n        B<span class=\"italic\"> Wee live unlike, and after milke not satisfyed with whole kingdomes, and now a dayes there is no end of riches and pleasures</span> <br>\n        C <span class=\"italic\">Wee dye alike, the royall septer haveing noe more prerogatives then the criples crutch</span><br>\n        D <span class=\"italic\">Though wee be buryed unlike, and covered with purple, or cheaper cloth, yet wee are all alike wormes meate</span><br>\n        E <span class=\"italic\">Wee shall arise alike, at the last day: stripte of all the lying vanities of fortune</span><br>\n        F <span class=\"italic\">Wee shall be rewarded unlike, either from Lazarus, or the rich Gluttons table with blessed or cursed estate forever </span>\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n          <li class=\"py-2\"><cite>The French Renaissance in Prints from the Bibliothèque Nationale de France</cite> catalogue (Los Angeles, 1994) refers to them as \"the hieroglyphic plates that were the invention of Martin Meurisse\", p. 432, re cat. no. 174.   </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">These have now been discussed by Susanne Berger in JWCI LXXVI (2013), 203-30</li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">For the suggested date of this sheet, see below.  </li>\n          <li class=\"py-2\">J.

The Winchester Wedding is based on a popular ballad by Tom D'Urfey (1653-1723) which features Ralph of Reading, and Black Bess of the Green, who 'Did together resort, and caused such sport, as before scarce ever was seen'.<sup>i</sup> It has been suggested that the ballad was composed by D'Urfey in 1682 on the occasion of Charles II's visit to Winchester; it was first published in 1682 or 1683.

A glance at the costume, however, will confirm that Stent cannot have been the first print-seller to issue the series, and, in fact, another plate in the Folger series bears the imprint 'Sould by Hugh Perry, 1628', which is assumed to be the first state. If we may thus assume a set of twelve prints issued in London in 1628, I believe we may thus importantly point to the existence of a 'print book', i.e. a number of uniform-size prints bound together and issued as a series, of the type popularised by Crispijn de Passe on the continent,<sup>i</sup> and which were eagerly copied by other publishers to   the growing enthusiasm for illustrations in students' <span class=\"italic\">alba amicorum</span>. Although the artist has not signed any of the dozen etched plates, on stylistic grounds, they may be confidently attributed to the Frankfurt engraver, Friedrich von Hulsen who is known to have worked in London in 1627 when he also etched the illustrations for George Carleton's <span class=\"italic\">A Thankfull Remembrance of Gods Mercy</span> (1627).</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        In our present etching, a woman stands four-square in the centre of the composition, two men on either side of her engaged in activities that clearly symbolise the Four Elements, one man at a forge (Fire), the others digging (Earth), fishing (Water) and hawking (Air). In the English version the woman's hand rests innocuously enough on her belly, while in earlier Continental versions of the motif she points unmistakably to her crotch.<sup>ii</sup>  \n        </p>\n\n        <p>The verse-caption reads:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        Fyer, Ayre, Earth, Water, represents,<br>\n        to thee their sundry Elaments. [sic]<br>\n        By which thou maist receive thy fill,<br>\n        that powerfull cann preserve & kill:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        We should perhaps understand the verses to mean that the author compares Woman to the Four Elements, essential to life, but sometimes also the cause of death. This was certainly not the original message of this motif, however, as we can tell from its immediate source, a print in a German work entitled the <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus Facetiarum</span>, printed in Strasbourg in 1608 and again in 1618 (and subsequently)—but which is only one of several representatives of the composition.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The bilingual Latin/German captions read thus:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"italic\">Aera perlustrant & aquas & viscera terrae<br>\n        Et flammas fatui o coram quam quaeritis adsum</span><br>\n        [They comb the skies, the waters, the flames, the bowels of the earth.<br>\n        Fools, what you seek is here right in front of you!]<br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">O ihr narren alle vier<br>\n        Waβ ihr sucht das fint ihr hier</span><br>\n        [Oh you fools, all four,<br>\n        What you seek you'll find right here!]\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        With her right hand she points to the general region of her crotch. Two years after the first edition of the  <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus</span>, the print was reissued in the  <span class=\"italic\">Jeucht Spieghel</span> (1610), and again in the  <span class=\"italic\">Nieuwen Ieucht Spieghe</span>l (Arnhem, 1617). But these seventeenth-century versions are rather less explicit than those of the previous century—at least these women are fully clothed, whereas their predecessors are entirely naked, and drive home the moral rather more pointedly. The  <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus</span> designer may have taken his inspiration from a print engraved by Johannes Wierix issued in 1601, where the words spoken by the naked woman are, if anything, more explicit:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"italic\">Graeft, vist, voghelt, En soeckt int vier<br>\n        Tis niet om vinden dan recht alhier</span><br>\n        [Dig, fish, fowl, seek it in the fire],<br>\n        Or as her French couplet baldly puts it:<br>\n        <span class=\"italic\">En vain cherches en terre eau ou flame<br>\n        car c'est a faire au seul trou de madame</span><br>\n        [In vain you search in earth, water or fire<br>\n        for it is only to be found in my lady's hole]\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">And there are at least three further sixteenth-century examples of the motif: the words issuing from the mouth of Balthasar Jenichen's naked woman, engraved some time in the 1580s, her fingers in her crotch, mock the vain strivings of the four fully-clothed men who surround her, busily engaged in what she clearly sees as no more than 'displacement activity':</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"italic\">Habt Ir kein Weibsbilt nie erkennt<br>\n        Das Irs svcht in den 4 Element?<br>\n        Solts Ir sehn habn an den Kindn<br>\n        Drvm svchts alda hie wert Irs findn</span><br>\n        [Have you never known a woman<br>\n        that you seek her in the Four Elements?<br>\n        You're looking all over for it like these children<br>\n        Though it's here you will find it]\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">It seems likely that an earlier and almost certainly woodcut version of such a sheet was once in the extraordinary print-collection of Ferdinand Columbus (d. 1539), for Inventory No. 2071 is described as featuring a standing naked woman with hair down to her buttocks, her right hand over her 'natura', and her left hand over her left breast, while below to our right is a man (presumably clothed) with a dog and a glove on his left hand, above which is a bird—so he is presumably out hawking. But though this is categorised as one of the sheets featuring five persons,<sup>iii</sup> the other three are not described. If we can accept that the cataloguer is describing a (centrally placed) naked woman and four other men, one of whom is hawking, I believe we may quite reasonably accept this as an example of <span class=\"italic\">Woman and the Men of the Four Elements</span>, not least, because we know the subject was available this early, in the form of a unique woodcut sheet attributed to Hans Weiditz c.1521. This, however, cannot have been the copy in Columbus's collection, as there the representative of Air is not accompanied by a dog.Having, I hope, demonstrated the Europe-wide popularity of the motif, I believe it was also familiar to the poet John Donne—but chronologically the 1628 English version is ruled out—and I set out my reasons in <span class=\"italic\">The Print in Early Modern England: an Historical Oversight</span> (London/New Haven, 2010), 318-320.</p>\n\n      <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n      <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n        <li class=\"py-2\">See I.M.

It comprises a leather-bound wooden box with a screen and two rollers; by rotating the ends of these, it is possible to view frame by frame through the 'screen' of the box a series of images which were evidently cut from a sheet and pasted together into a long continuous strip. This panorama, which has a truly popular appearance, must date - on internal evidence - from around 1680 (see below). If it bears a title or any imprint information, this is inaccessible on account of the sealed nature of the casing, and the same is true of the only other known example of such an artefact, the closely similar <span class=\"italic\">Common Cries of London</span> sheet, now preserved in an exactly comparable case in the Lilly Library of Indiana University at Bloomington</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Here we display, first, a view of the box with its rollers and an image appearing within the screen, and second, an attempt to reconstruct the entire sheet from which the strip of images contained within it might have been formed: it seems likely that these might originally have been arranged in three, four, or perhaps five rows as shown here. This reconstruction is intended more for the convenience of displaying all the constituent images than as an assemblage in which I feel much confidence can be placed: however, since to take the object apart would be to destroy it, this is the closest to a reconstruction that we are ever likely to come. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        <span class=\"float-right pr-6 pb-2\"><img :src=\"thumbnail1\" width=\"200\"/> <a href=\"#\" @click=\"getSecondImage()\" class=\"underline font-bold\" >View larger image</a></span> \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">Apart from the technical interest of the artefact in which it is preserved, the series of images is of considerable importance for the study of late seventeenth-century English popular culture, not least since it includes the earliest depictions of such 'folk heroes', national stereotypes, <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span> and other <span class=\"italic\">drôleries</span> as</p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        A Graceless Knave<br>\n        An Overdoing Knave<br>\n        A flatring Knave<br>\n        A Cheating Knave<br>\n        Punchenello<br>\n        Punchenello's Wife<br>\n        Whiping Tom<br>\n        Skiping Jone<br>\n        A boy with puppies<br>\n        Mother Louse<br>\n        Time carys away the Pop[e]<br>\n        A Baboon playing on a ho boy [oboe]<br>\n        A Baboon drinks to a monkey<br>\n        A monkey Smokes a pip<br>\n        A Baboon plays on a lute<br>\n        An Ape barbs<sup>i</sup> the Catt<br>\n        A Catt in briches<br>\n        A Catt fidleing and myce danceing<br>\n        A Bear playing on a harp<br>\n        A dog in a Coate<br>\n        A hog in armor<br>\n        Warping Jack Spanyard<br>\n        Monsier Jack with his Stolen hens on his back<br>\n        An Apish Mountebanck<br>\n        An Apish Costermonger\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        There are thus no fewer than twenty-five individual scenes. The similar <span class=\"italic\">Common Cries of London</span> sheet in the Lilly Library, which has already been noted, features twenty-nine individual criers, but this too unfortunately bears no imprint or other useful dating information, and is rather to be dated from the present sheet than <span class=\"italic\">vice versa</span>. One of the smaller human heads that, together with small animals and birds, powder the background of the present sheet is a crowned male - certainly intended for Charles II - which therefore gives a date-range of 1660-1685 for the original print, but there are various other 'internal' facts that allow us to narrow down the date somewhat, and principally, the presence of 'Whiping Tom'.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        'Whipping Tom' is first heard of in print in 1681, in two broadside ballads (<span class=\"italic\">Whipping Tom, or, The deceitfull kinsman</span> and <span class=\"italic\">Whipping-Tom turn'd citizen</span>), and a prose sheet entitled <span class=\"italic\">Whipping Tom brought to light, and exposed to view</span>, which at first sight, might seem to narrow the date of our print down to the years 1681-5, except that this latter sheet records that the present mysterious flagellant 'is of the Generation of that Whipping Tom, that about Nine years since proved such an Enemy to the Milk-wenches Bums', thus appearing to attest to the existence of another whipster, known by the same name, and operating c.1672 in the countryside. Other chronological indicators do not afford any greater precision - a half-length portrait of Mother Louse, the celebrated Oxford alewife, was engraved by David Loggan c.1665,<sup>ii</sup> which may have brought her fame to a wider public than the university students for whom she catered, and the present image is certainly dependent on Loggan's, but that does not help us date the Yale sheet. Strictly speaking, then, we may perhaps date it between 1672 and 1685, but I feel happy enough to see it as originating in the earlier half of the 1680s.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        It is interesting to see the designer copying five engravings made by Hollar back in the early 1640s amongst the sheet's twenty-five figures; the first four - as the captions indicate - are from his <span class=\"italic\">Pake of Knaves</span> with trivial changes, the fifth, 'Time carys away the Pop[e]' was engraved as a single-sheet print by Hollar c.1641.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        With her right hand she points to the general region of her crotch. Two years after the first edition of the  <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus</span>, the print was reissued in the  <span class=\"italic\">Jeucht Spieghel</span> (1610), and again in the  <span class=\"italic\">Nieuwen Ieucht Spieghe</span>l (Arnhem, 1617). But these seventeenth-century versions are rather less explicit than those of the previous century - at least these women are fully clothed, whereas their predecessors are entirely naked, and drive home the moral rather more pointedly. The  <span class=\"italic\">Pugillus</span> designer may have taken his inspiration from a print engraved by Johannes Wierix issued in 1601, where the words spoken by the naked woman are, if anything, more explicit:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        I cannot find any evidence for the independent existence of 'Skiping Joan' elsewhere, and it seems probable that she was invented merely as a (rhyming) female partner for Whipping Tom, and similarly provided with a three-thonged whip. 'Punchenello's Wife', on the other hand - known to us nowadays as 'Judy' - and her husband, indeed, are a most interesting presence. Samuel Pepys seems to be the first to have noted a Punch-and-Judy show in England, in his diary entry for 9 May 1662, and references to the figure become more frequent from the later 1660s, though Punch's long-suffering wife does not appear to be mentioned until rather later than the date of our print, and these would appear to be the earliest-known English depictions of either. Punch is far from grotesque here, rather ordinary-looking, in fact, though short and sporting a small moustache; Judy is rather masculine in appearance, despite her full skirt.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        Two of the figures appear to be foreign nationals, 'Warping Jack Spanyard' and the presumably French 'Monsier Jack with his stolen hens on his back', though neither figure is presented as a caricature visually. I am not clear in quite what sense the Spaniard is 'warping' - nor is it apparent from the image - unless he is meant to be distorting or contorting his body or features. He is, however, clearly derived from the undated <span class=\"italic\">Signiour Bobbadilli Puntado Cavalliro Puff or The Proud Vapouring Spaniard</span> which bears the imprint, 'London Printed Coulered and Sold by Ro:Walton at the Globe and Compasses, in St Paules Church-yard: on the North side', over traces of an earlier one, and is preserved only in the 'tobacciana' collections of two American public libraries.<sup>iii</sup> It may well be that the panorama artist's 'Monsier Jack' similarly derives from another such xenophobic stereotype, perhaps a companion piece, but if so, it is unknown to me. \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        'A boy with puppies' perhaps derives from one of the two lost prints sold by Stent and his successor Overton, and advertised in their catalogues of 1662 and 1673 as 'Boy with puppies' and 'Boy and puppies',<sup>iv</sup> and for all its diminutive size, this sketch is far from crude; the boy has lifted up his shift (thus exposing his nakedness) and cradles the puppies - four noses [?] can just be made out - in his shirt-lap, while the mother stands on her hind legs in her attempt to reach the pups, her swollen teats evident. There is a mezzotint of the subject published by John Smith in the late 17/early 18 century with traces of an earlier imprint beneath, and that it must have become something of a genre scene success is indicated by a contemporary London delftware figurine found in Lower Marsh, Lambeth, and now in the Museum of London.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The remaining twelve images are all of performing animals, and more than half of them <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span> -- in the literal sense of that term. To these we now turn. The taste for pictures of monkeys 'aping' human activities goes back well into the Middle Ages, of course, and the images in the margins of Gothic manuscripts, but the earliest such <span class=\"italic\">prints</span> belong to the final quarter of the fifteenth century, and depict what was already a popular visual motif, the pedlar whose pack is rifled by apes while he sleeps, probably best known today in the version engraved by Pieter van der Heyden after Bruegel in 1562, which, as Janson pointed out, 'served as the <span class=\"italic\">locus classicus</span> of [the] motif from the 1560's until well into the seventeenth century'.<sup>v</sup> He further noted that the widely-travelled Thomas Coryate was puzzled as to the significance of a mural of the motif which he described in some detail as seen on the wall of the inn he stayed at in Lyons in 1608 - interesting incidental evidence of the natural tendency for a seventeenth-century Englishman to assume such a representation must necessarily be 'emblematic' in some way:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        'on the South side of the wal of another court [of mine Inne], there was a very pretty and merry story painted, which was this: A certaine Pedler having a budget full of small wares, fell asleepe as he was travelling on the way, to whom there came a great multitude of Apes, and robbed him of all his wares while he was asleepe: some of those Apes were painted with pouches or budgets at their backes, which they stole out of the pedlers fardle climing up to trees, some with spectacles on their noses, some with beades about their neckes, some with touch-boxes and inke-hornes in their hands, some with crosses and censour boxes, some with cardes in their hands; al which things they stole out of the budget: and amongst the rest one putting downe the Pedlers breeches, and kissing his naked, &c. This pretty conceit seemeth to import some merry matter, but truely I know not the morall of it.'<sup>vi</sup>  \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        A series of sixteen plates etched c.1560 by Peeter van der Borcht seems to underlie, if not indeed to have originated, the increasing taste for similar <span class=\"italic\"></span>singeries in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Van der Borcht's <span class=\"italic\"></span>Pedlar Robbed by Apes (on which Bruegel's design depends) is not part of this series, however,<sup>vii</sup> a fact which attests to the pre-existing popularity of the theme, and, indeed, it seems likely that it was the very popularity of the Apes and Pedlar motif which gave Van der Borcht the idea for his series in the first place. His etching is a copy in reverse of van der Heyden's after Bruegel which was first issued by Cock in Antwerp in 1562. Until as recently as 2003 there was no known English print of this very popular European motif, but in that year the British Museum acquired a print which is a slightly enlarged copy in reverse of Van der Borcht's engraving, bearing the imprint, 'Are to be sold by Robert Pricke in White Cross street near Cripplegate Church RP excud.', which was Pricke's address until 1676. The only other known impression, in the Douce collection in Oxford, bears an imperfectly erased imprint which can still be just made out as reading, 'at the Ball in St Pauls Churchyard', which was Pricke's address from c.1677.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        The designer of the Yale Center panorama was nothing if not eclectic, and all seven of his ape compositions derive from <span class=\"italic\">singeries </span>engraved by Coryn Boel (d.1668) after designs by David Teniers the Younger. Two of them, 'An Ape barbs the Catt' and 'An Apish Mountebanck', derive from his <span class=\"italic\"></span>Barber-surgeon's Shop,<sup>viii</sup> but Boel also engraved a series of six <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span> prints (plus title-page engraving) on which the remaining five ape scenes are based. The 'Apish Costermonger' and 'A Baboon drinks to a monkey'<sup>ix</sup> are based on the print of the two apes playing backgammon; 'A monkey smokes a pipe'- cf. also the print of the cat and pipe-smoking ape playing cards issued in 1646 and surviving uniquely amongst the Thomason Tracts in the British Library — is from that depicting two apes smoking; and 'A Baboon plays on a lute' derives from the print showing two monkeys making music. For his baboon oboist ('A Baboon playing on a ho boy') - especially given the length of the instrument - he probably took the hint from a detail of the title-page engraving. The taste for <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span> was certainly still current c.1690 to judge from the clutch of catalogues of paintings put up for auction around that date, in which we read of 'A piece of Monkeys shaving a Cat',<sup>x</sup> and - if it is not the same item held over as unsold to two further sales - three lots described as 'a Monkey trimming a Cat',<sup>xi</sup> as well as 'Some Monkeys playing at Cards',<sup>xii</sup> 'A Monkeys Feast',<sup>xiii</sup> and 'a p[ie]c[e] of monkeys smoaking and 2 prints'<sup>xiv</sup> - a rare specification of prints for sale at auction, and presumably, prints of <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span>.  Another from Boel's singeries series, two apes eating oysters, is preserved as a print entitled <span class=\"italic\">The Monkeys Mockefeast</span> uniquely in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York<sup>xv</sup> Though the PML impression has an erased imprint, it is advertised in Stent's 1662 catalogue, and was probably acquired by him in the 1650s, at exactly the time, indeed, when the taste for such <span class=\"italic\">singeries</span> in England appears to begin.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        I have not been able to point to a similarly precise source for the Yale panorama artist's bear harpist, or his 'Catt fidleing and myce dancing'. Some of these amusing animal images would have been familiar as shop or tavern signs, however, part of the popular art of the street; four Cat & Fiddles, for example, are attested for the 1660s (one a haberdasher's shop, recorded from 1667-77).<sup>xvi</sup> Though we cannot know whether any of these signs included 'myce dancing' while the cat fiddled, this addition would have been common enough, and is found, for example, on an English Delftware charger probably painted in Lambeth c.1730.  A tavern attested in Southwark in the 1650s and 60s had as its sign an ape seated and smoking a pipe.  In similar vein, Chettle refers in passing to a 'signe of the Ape and the Urinall' in <span class=\"italic\">Kind-harts Dreame</span> (1592), as in the present 'Apish Mountebanck' scene. Contemporary with the Yale print, A Hog in Armor is recorded in Fleet Street in 1678,<sup>xix</sup> and was one of the inn-names Addison held up for ridicule in <span class=\"italic\">The Spectator</span> of 2 April 1710:\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2 italic\">\n        'Our streets are filled with blue boars, black swans, and red lions, not to mention flying pigs   and hogs in armour, with many creatures more extraordinary than any in the deserts of Africa.' <sup>xxi</sup>  \n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        But 'a hog in armour' is also a popular phrase, first recorded in English in Howell's <span class=\"italic\">English Proverbs</span> (1659): 'He looketh like a Hogg in armour', and came to mean 'an awkward or clumsy person, stiff and ill at ease in his attire' (OED). Similarly, '[as proud as] a dog in a doublet' was also listed by Howell, though this popular alliterative formula is found as early as 1577, and is perhaps relevant to the Yale sheet's image captioned 'A dog in a Coate'- a sight presumably no less strange than that of 'A Catt in briches'.\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"pb-2\">\n        While prints might also function as toys, as things to amuse the children, of course, there is no guarantee that the Yale Center's 'panorama' of unknown title was <span class=\"italic\">designed</span> for juvenile viewers. The fact that the 'Overdoing Knave' brandishes an alarming clyster-pipe and seems about to administer an enema to the diminutive dog beside him, or that in another Hollar-derived image, 'Time carries off the Pope on his back', does not preclude a youthful audience, however - sensibilities change, <span class=\"italic\">autres temps, autres mœurs</span>!\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 class=\"py-2 text-xl font-bold\">Footnotes</h4> \n        <ul class=\"list-[lower-roman] list-inside\">\n        <li class=\"py-2\">i.e. acts as barber to, shaves. </li>\n        <li class=\"py-2\">F.G.
