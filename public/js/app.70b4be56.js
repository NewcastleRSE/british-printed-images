Images to 1700 is a gateway to the visual culture of the Tudor and Stuart period.

It contains depictions of some of the period’s main events (the Gunpowder Plot, Civil Wars, Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Restoration, Revolution of 1688, and Nine Years’ War), representations of its ideas and beliefs (political protest, religion, mythology, and fables), and its understanding of the natural world (anatomy, science, animals, plants, and flowers). There are images of people (from royalty to ordinary folk), places (from palaces to alehouses), and activities (from eating and drinking to washing and shaving). The prints record the incidental details of early modern life, the clothes, objects, and wares that defined people’s place in their society.</p><p class="py-4">In addition to the database, this website contains <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="#">resources</a> to enhance users’ understanding of printed images and inspire further <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="#">research</a> in the field.

Software and database design was undertaken by Research Software Engineering, Newcastle University.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">The Corpus</h2><div class="mt-4 text-left"><p class="py-4">The database contains almost 11,000 prints and book illustrations (that number includes multiple states and impressions of the same print). Much of the corpus is held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, with some additional material held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Additional prints and book illustrations will be added in the future. The prints have been catalogued using terms derived and adapted from Iconclass and the Library of Congress Subject Headings. They can be searched according to Printmaker, Subject, Person, Event, or Technique. </p><p class="py-4">The date 1700 is an approximate cut-off point for the corpus. Many political prints produced during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-14) are included as are those produced by printmakers whose careers spanned the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. For example, John Smith, one of the most important printmakers of the Restoration, continued to be active until his death in the early 1740s. ‘British’ print is also an approximate term. Most of the prints in the corpus were produced in Britain, but many were made by foreign-born artists. Prints made on the continent but depicting events in Britain (such as Dutch satires on the Anglo-Dutch wars or Revolution of 1688) are also included.</p><p class="py-4"> Despite its size, the database is not a complete record of the period’s printed imagery. Prints are dispersed in collections across the world, and no one repository can hope to achieve completion. Printed ballads are largely absent from the corpus (see the <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Bodleian Library’s Broadside Ballad</a> project for access to that material), as are most of the early modern period’s book illustrations (though a catalogue of those produced between 1604-1640 is available). Finally, although many of Hollar’s works are in this database, there are absences in the corpus. The University of Toronto’s <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://hollar.library.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Wenceslaus Hollar Digital Collection</a> is an excellent resource for those wishing to look further. </p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h3 class="mt-2 text-1xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-xl text-left">Copyright</h3><div class="mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left"><p class="py-4">All images in the database are subject to copyright.

There are images of people (from royalty to ordinary folk), places (from palaces to alehouses), and activities (from eating and drinking to washing and shaving).

Both are valid types of research projects, but how you draw on the prints in the Bpi1700 may be different in each project.</p><h3 class="mt-2 text-1xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 italic">Basing a dissertation on prints.</h3><p class="py-4"> There are lots of ways that you might do this. First, it is essential to consider what you want the subject of your research project to be (and why). Will you focus on:</p><ul><li> - <span class="font-bold">A period or event?</span> Perhaps you are interested in the role of images at specific moments? Coronations or royal weddings, for example. Or during moments of political crisis? The Exclusion Crisis (1678-82) or the Revolution of 1688 produced many political prints. You may even wish to be more specific and consider one aspect of those sources. The role of Dutch prints in British politics, for example. Searching for Romeyn de Hooghe would be a good place to start.</li><li> - <span class="font-bold">An artist or publisher?</span> Perhaps you want to focus on the prints made by one engraver or publisher. Will you trace developments? Explore themes in their work? Or, perhaps, place them in an artistic or cultural context? There are plenty of engravers to choose from - the <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/resources/directories" target="_blank"> Printmakers directory</a> is a good place to look. Alternatively, you may want to think about how the work of a painter (Godfrey Kneller or Peter Lely, perhaps) was disseminated in prints. </li><li> - <span class="font-bold">A theme or topic?</span> Perhaps you are interested in how early modern people understood their world. The subject search will help you here. You will be able to find prints depicting the natural world (plants, flowers, animals, birds, agriculture, and so on). These make up a significant part of the archive. Perhaps you are interested in how ethnicity or nationality was understood in the period? Prints depicting non-Europeans and different European nationalities will be a useful way in thinking about this. </li></ul><p class="py-4"> This approach allows you to identify a discrete body of source material quite quickly. This will give your research project definable parameters. The next stage will be to move on to analysing and contextualising the sources. This is the trickier (and more fun) part of the research process, and there are plenty of <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/resources" target="_blank">resources</a> on this website to help. The first step is to establish what it is you want to know? What questions are you asking of the prints?</p><h3 class="mt-2 text-1xl italic tracking-tight text-gray-900"> Using prints alongside other sources</h3><p class="py-4"> The bpi material might also be used to complement other types of primary sources. Frontispieces might help you study to works of a particular author, for example. Religious imagery might shed a new light on the Reformations. Images here might not be the main thrust of your project but using them alongside other sources will be fruitful. A research project on a political controversy might draw on texts (pamphlets or books), ballads, and printed images - weaving a range of sources together in one analysis will provide a richer and fuller sense of the debate.</p><p class="py-4"> The question to ask is what visual sources might add to your research project. For example, perhaps your research project considers the history of gender. Visual sources will allow you to think about how masculinity and femininity were understood, represented, and expressed this period. Portraiture is one type of source we can use to study this. How are men and women portrayed? How does this vary by social rank? Were these idealistic depictions and, if so, what might this tell us? Conversely, your project may also consider how gender was used to represent ideas or concepts. How and why were virtues, senses, and emotions depicted in gendered ways? </p><h3 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Researching prints</h3><p class="py-4"> Once you have designed your research project and identified the prints you would like to study the next stage is to think about the questions you will ask of your sources. In one sense, images are no different from other types of sources you use as historians, and you should consider the following:</p><ul><li> - <span class="font-bold">Intention:</span> Why was the image produced? What was the artist trying to do? Why did people want to buy it or look at it? Does the tone of the image (satirical, polemical, memorial, and so on) help us to answer these questions?</li><li> - <span class="font-bold">Content:</span> Who and/or what is depicted? Can you unpick the image? </li><li> - <span class="font-bold">Audience:</span> Who was the image for? How might it have been viewed? </li><li> - <span class="font-bold">Context:</span> Was the image part of a genre of prints? Did it conform to iconographic conventions? Was it produced at a specific political or cultural moment? Did it relate to other prints or images, and how did they inform it?</li></ul><p class="py-4"> Each entry in the bpi archive contains bibliographic information that will be important in answering these questions. Compiling information on the who, what, and when of a print may help you to answer the why. As such, establishing when a print was made and by who will be essential groundwork for your research. After that, it will be worth considering if other art historians/historians have written about any of your sources.

Her study places carvings, plasterwork, and paintings in domestic spaces in the broader visual culture of early modern England (including printed images). The books by Walsham and Watt use visual sources alongside textual ones - images are used as one way into the history of period. Watt considers the purpose of images on religious ballads, and Walsham shows how early modern understandings of providence and generations (respectively) can be unlocked through the study of visual sources. Aston&#39;s book uses one painting as a way into the history of England&#39;s Reformation and its history of iconoclasm and conflict.

For a broadside with the same plate and letterpress on the 1680 procession, see 1849-3-15-69. (Text from Antony Griffiths, \'The Print in Stuart Britain\', BM 1998, cat.197) The solemn mock processions, held on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth\'s accession on 17 November over the three years from 1679-81, were carefully staged by the Whigs as part of their campaign to weaken the Tories and exclude James from the succession. The day had been marked by bonfires and burnings of the Pope in effigy since the early 1670\'s, but the event of 1679 was on a completely different scale. It must have cost the Whigs a very large sum, which was raised through subscriptions from the Party and by secret contributions from the French ambassador, Barillon, whose constant aim was to ensure that the King and Parliament were always at loggerheads (George p.46). Church bells awoke London at 3am. After fourteen hours of revelry, the procession itself began at 5pm, with the now dark city illuminated by fires and torches. It threaded its way through the streets of the City, past an estimated 500,000 spectators. The bulk of the crowd gathered at the end of the route, at the Whig headquarters at the Green Ribbon Club at the King\'s Head Tavern near Temple Bar, by the statue of Queen Elizabeth, where wine and beer were available free to anyone proclaiming their abhorrence of Popery. The print shows how apprentices cleared the way for an effigy of Justice Godfrey held by one of his murderers dressed as a Jesuit, who was followed by a procession of figures dressed in the habits of various Catholic orders, with the Pope himself at the end accompanied by the devil. At the end of the procession (top left) the dummy was thrown onto a pyre. (See S.Williams, \'The Pope-burning processions of 1679, 1680 and 1681\', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XXI 1958, pp.104-17.) This elaborate and well-engraved print was published in January 1680 as a commemoration and follow-up to the procession itself, as is shown by a long advertisement for it in the \'Domestic Intellegencer\' for 9 January which gives the price as 6d. The letterpress of the broadsheet gives two addresses \'at the King\'s Arms in the Poultry and at the Feathers in Lumbard Street near the Post Office\'. The first is of Dorman Newman, the second is is of Samuel Lee, who also published the broadsheet of the 1680 procession. A later advertisement in the \'Mercurius Civicus\' for 3 April 1680 gives the name of yet another publisher, Jonathan Wilkins at the Star in Cheapside. Although his name is not given, the design can be attributed with some confidence to Francis Barlow, who is known to have designed other anti-Papal prints. The engraver remains unidentified. For the Procession of 1680, another engraved broadsheet was produced by the same team (BMSat 1085). It shows the series of floats that were prepared with pageants of Popish devilry, and the design can be attributed with equal confidence to Barlow. The text implies that the print was sold during the procession itself, and an unillustrated pamphlet, \'The solemn mock-procession\', which advertises this print, was a product of the same propaganda machine (Williams p.106). Underneath the names of the three publishers is a note \'There will be no other true representation of this procession but this.\' This did not stop a rival engraving (BMSat 1084) being published by John Oliver in collaboration with two other publishers; George (p.53 n.2) very plausibly attributes it to Stephen College. Luttrell\'s annotation on his impression (now in the British Museum) shows that Oliver\'s print came out on 1 December, only a fortnight after the procession - an indication of how quickly a plate could be designed and engraved when necessary.","jpgNum":"333648.jpg"},{"id":7836,"title":"","description":"A satirical broadside on the Popish Plot and and its consequences with an etching showing the Pope in an elaborate bed, beside which a table contains a crucifix and papal accoutrements, alarmed by the arrival of a procession of ghosts in their shrouds.

It was one of the last attempts of the Whig propaganda machine to rally support, and shows the apotheosis of the four chief witnesses to the Plot (Oates, Prance, Dugdale and Bedloe) triumphing over the plotting of \'the infernall conclave\' of Papists. Although the engraver is unidentified (the manner appears to be of Robert White), the design is certainly by Barlow. His original drawing for the lower half of the design survives in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (first recognised and attributed by Richard Godfrey; see \'English caricature 1620 to the present\', Victoria & Albert Museum, 1984, cat.4). The publisher Benjamin Combe, at the Ball and Anchor in Lombard Street, is otherwise unknown, which suggests that he was a Whig agent. Barlow\'s work as a designer of satires has only recently become the subject of study (see Hodnett pp.26-33), for he never signed his work in this field. It is the surviving drawings that prove his involvement, and allow other attributions. His signed work of these years are the large natural history prints made for Pierce Tempest. But his patron William Cavendish, 4th Earl and later first Duke of Devonshire, to whom he dedicated the second edition of his Aesop in 1687 with an acknowledgement of \'Your Lordship\'s many favours towards me\', was a prominent Whig and a central figure in the attempt to exclude James from the succession. To the designs listed by Hodnett, Richard Godfrey has informed us that he would add two others on stylistic grounds: \'The Devill\'s Triumph over Rome\'s idoll\' (BMSat 1079), and \'The Dreadful apparition, or The Pope haunted with Ghosts\' (BMSat 1091). The only satire actually etched by Barlow himself is an anti-Dutch etching, known as the \'Cheese of Dutch Rebellion\' in which the Devil surprises a group of Dutchmen plotting within a large hollow oval cheese. It is conventionally dated c.1673 (BMSat 1045). ..........

The print has been folded to form a letter addressed to van der Borcht on one side. On the verso is a letter which gives a valuable insight into the relationship between the two men (Hollar dedicated P.272 to him), and into Hollar\'s approach to his prints. \'According to the wish of your son Hendrick I am forwarding you a proof of this print, made in his presence. You must not think that this is a perfect proof, for I printed it immediately after removing it from the acid. The entire plate needs to be corrected against the original. I am therefore very unwilling to send the proof since I take care that no-one should see them until they have reached perfection. So what you see here is simply what the acid has done, and it still needs to be gone over again with the needle. Hendrick has gone to the country and sends you his greetings.

The drawing used was in Arundel\'s collection, and is related to a fresco by Giulio in the Casino della Grotta of the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. The son of Seleucus was condemned to be blinded as punishment for adultery; his father offered one of his own eyes in order to save one of his son\'s. (Arundel\'s drawing is now in the British Museum (Pp.2-94), but is an old copy rather than Giulio\'s original.) The significance of this print to Hollar is shown by its being found printed both in red ink (as here) and in blue (impression in Prague); this is quite exceptional.

Wenceslaus Hollar, the most prolific printmaker of his period and a refugee from his native Bohemia, spent many years years of his life in London in the service of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel (1585 - 1646 ) the great connoisseur and patron of the arts. Together with its pendant, a portrait of the artist\'s father, Albrecht DÃ¼rer the Elder of 1497(London, National Gallery; Anzelewsky 48) DÃ¼rer\'s self-portrait had been presented in 1636 by the city of Nuremberg to King Charles I. through the Earl of Arundel. The Earl had stopped in the city that year, while leading an embassy to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II in Vienna from the English king. The inscription along the lower edge of Hollar\'s print indicates that it was made in Antwerp in 1645, after a painting in the collection of the Earl of Arundel.

Tudor and early-Stuart portraits are mainly of royalty and nobility, though the compilation <span class="italic">Herωologia</span> included portraits of leading Englishmen in various walks of life. During the Civil Wars and the Restoration there was a demand for portraits of public figures for which print-sellers like Peter Stent and John Overton catered. The introduction of mezzotint printing at the Restoration was an important development for portraiture, the genre of print for which it was principally used. John Smith was the leading mezzotiner for nearly half a century until his death in 1743.</p><div class="mt-10 text-left"><p>The variety of portrait prints suggests that they served a range of purposes. Large, single-sheet prints were intended as memorials of the person depicted. It seems likely that these were often hung up on the walls of houses, probably coated with varnish, though by definition those treated in this way have not survived. Smaller plates were often inserted in books or albums. Surviving examples include those of Samuel Pepys, preserved at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and that kept by the Somerset landowner and M.P., Sir Philip Sydenham, held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Books of flowers, birds and animals</h2><div class="mt-4 text-left"><p class="py-4">A popular genre from the early 17th century onwards, these books derived from Dutch exemplars. Many of the earliest examples were copied from originals published by Crispijn de Passe and others, including most of those produced by John Payne, who worked between 1620 and 1640. The books were popular partly for the information about natural phenomena that they conveyed, but also as pattern books for embroidery. Such books took on a new lease of life when the slightly stilted images purveyed by the likes of Payne were replaced by more naturalistic ones in the works produced by Francis Barlow and his successors.

They ranged from simple woodblock scenes and diagrams to series of engraved plates. Woodcuts were easier to use for book illustration than engravings because they could be printed in the middle of a typeset page and could be reused far more times. The earliest woodcut illustrations include those in William Caxton&#39;s edition of Chaucer&#39;s <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> (1483) and woodcuts were used for cheap publications throughout our period. </p><p class="py-4">Engraved images had to be printed separately on a different press. Despite being more difficult to produce, they became increasingly prevalent. Thomas Geminus pioneered their use in his illustrations to Vesalius (1545). By the 1630s engraved plates were produced for works like Ovid&#39;s <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, and in the 1650s and 1660s series of plates were included John Ogilby&#39;s editions of Aesop, Homer, and Virgil. Engraved illustrations were also included in scientific books.

The architectural engravings which appeared in David Loggan&#39;s lavish <span class="italic">Oxonia Illustrata</span> (1675), and its sequel <span class="italic"></span>Cantabrigia Illustrata (1690) were equally innovative.

In the 16th-century they were predominantly woodcuts, but from c.1600 they were often engraved plates.

The technique was first used to produce such items as single-sheet devotional images, and a facsimile of one of these that is in our corpus (bpi1008). Woodcut book illustrations also appeared from an early date. Caxton&#39;s edition of Chaucer&#39;s <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> (1477) and in books produced by Wynkyn de Worde (d.1534/5) were notable examples. </p><div class="mt-10 text-left"><p>Important developments occurred in the 1530s and 1540s. Hans Holbein (d.1543) introduced a new genre into England. His illustrative titlepage for the Coverdale Bible (1535) became established the form for titlepages across the 16th and 17th centuries, in which printed images summarised the content or argument of a book in pictorial form. This period also saw the first production of engravings made in metal. Thomas Geminus (1510-62) pioneered this practice in the plates he produced for Vesalius&#39; <span class="italic">De humani corporis fabrica</span>, an anatomical book published in London in 1545. Plates from this book are in the BPI corpus, including a striking image of a flayed man (bpi1038). </p><p class="py-4"> In the Elizabethan period book illustrations developed further, largely because of the printshop of John Day. Day&#39;s output included several heavily illustrated texts, including Stephen Bateman&#39;s <span class="italic">A Christall Glasse of Christian Reformation</span> (1569), William Cunningham&#39;s <span class="italic">The cosmographical glasse</span> (1559), Jan van der Noot, <span class="italic">Theatre of Worldlings</span> (1569). The most significant was John Foxe&#39;s <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> (first published in 1563), often called ‘The Book of Martyrs&#39;, which used images in an unprecedented scale. This used illustrations on an unprecedented scale and included scenes of martyrdom that became famous in English history. Some of those images are included in the database (bpi5083-5119). Cartographic prints were also developed in this period, most famously in Saxton&#39;s <span class="italic">Atlas of England and Wales</span> (1579), and the Armada charts produced by Augustine Ryther were also significant (bpi8978-8989). Portraits were the other principal type of printed image produced in this period. </p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-2 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Early-17th Century</h2><p class="mt-6 text-left">Most of the artists who made printed images in 16th-century England were foreigners: Holbein, Geminus, and Jodocus Hondius, a Protestant fleeing persecution, being the most prominent. The importance of immigrants to British printmaking continued in the early-17th century, with notable engravers like Francis Delaram and the de Passe family establishing themselves in the reigns of James VI/I and Charles I. There were native-born artists active in this period. William Rogers&#39; portrait of Elizabeth I (1589) was the first print signed by an English engraver (bpi708) and Renold Elstracke (1570-1625) and John Payne (1607-47) made important contributions in the subsequent generation. </p><div class="mt-4 text-left"><p>There was an upsurge in the woodcut trade in the Jacobean period, and engravings also became increasingly common. These years saw a growing number of specialist dealers in prints, such as the partners Sudbury and Humble, and their rivals, Compton and Henry Holland. These men dealt in prints produced in England, but also commissioned work overseas for the English market, including <span class="italic">Herωologia </span>(1620), a volume of portraits of leading Englishmen. </p><p class="py-4"> Portraits continued to dominate printmaking. Portraits of the Stuart royal family and members of their courts were popular. Charles I on horseback by Elstrack (1612) is an interesting example(bpi59). The head of the figure was adapted in subsequent versions (1616 and 1625) as the prince&#39;s appearance changed. Other genres also flourished at this time. Engraved titlepages became increasingly common, while new genres were introduced, including botanical prints derived from Dutch models, sets of allegorical figures, political prints, and satires of popular vices. Prints offer a glimpse into events and places, such as the engravings of the triumphal arches that lined the streets of the City of London for the Coronation of James I, or the etching of the gardens of Wilton House by their designer, Isaac de Caus (bpi3909-20). </p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Mid-17th Century</h2><p class="mt-4 text-left">Print production burgeoned in the mid-17th century. Two figures were central to its development: Wenceslaus Hollar and Peter Stent. Hollar (1607-77) entered the service of the Earl of Arundel during the latter&#39;s European tour in the 1630s and spent much of the rest of his life in England. Hollar was both talented and prolific. He produced prints in virtually every genre, topography (including the famous Long View of London), maps, portraits, allegories, satires, and natural histories. The BPI does not offer a comprehensive series of Hollar&#39;s work, but he is well represented in its corpus. </p><div class="mt-4 text-left"><p>Peter Stent (d.1665) was a print-seller who mass-produced prints from 1642. The outbreak of the Civil War led to an unprecedented demand for topical engravings. Stent produced engravings of subjects linked to the War, including portraits of military figures, maps of battles, and political satires. But as an advertisement he printed in 1654 shows, he also offered prints on a wide variety of subjects: portraits, maps, copy books, and series of prints of flowers and animals. The advertisement (the first to survive for printed images) hints at how buoyant the market for prints had become by the mid-century. Stent employed artists to meet the demand for prints of all kinds, including Hollar and prolific English engravers like Richard Gaywood (1644-80). </p><p class="py-4"> The 1650s saw other innovative enterprises in printmaking. John Ogilby (1600-76) produced the first of a series of books illustrated with lavish engravings, including editions of Aesop (bpi8121-44) and Virgil. And Sir William Dugdale (1605-86) pioneered the production of engravings of medieval cathedrals, abbeys, and churches to illustrate the first volume of the great <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1655) that he produced with Roger Dodsworth. </p></div></div></section>',3),Qs={class:"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"},Ys=(0,o.uE)('<div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Late-17th Century</h2><p class="mt-4 text-left">The Restoration consolidated the innovations of the revolutionary period. Stent and his successor, John Overton, continued to sell a wide range of prints, as a 1662 advertisement of his wares from 1662 demonstrates. The fact that rival dealers Thomas Jenner and Robert Walton now entered the market showed that demand for prints was growing. Ogilby also continued to thrive in this period, as did another talented engraver of birds and animals, Francis Barlow (1626-1704), who produced lavish sets of natural history scenes. Barlow was one of the most important printmakers of the century. </p><div class="mt-4 text-left"><p>Demand for engraved portraits also grew rapidly. Engravers like William Faithorne (1616-91) and Robert White (1645-1703) were leading producers. A new technique, the mezzotint, was principally used for portraiture after its introduction in the 1670s and contributed to the availability of and demand for prints. By the 1680s, Isaac Beckett (1653-1719) was the leading mezzotint artist. He was succeeded in this role by John Smith (1652-1742), who produced mezzotint portraits well into the 18th century. Both Beckett and Smith are well represented in the BPI database. </p><p class="py-4"> New genres also emerged in this period. Scientific books like Robert Hooke&#39;s Micrographia (1665) with its detailed engravings of substances and creatures under the microscope, including the highly magnified flea, were notable. Sets of architectural engravings like David Loggan&#39;s Oxonia Illustrata (1675) and its Cambridge equivalent were equally innovative, Marcellus Laroon&#39;s Cries of London series (1687) depicted the lives of ordinary people. Political satires became more widespread in this period, particularly after the Popish Plot and Succession Crisis (1678-82) and Revolution of 1688, with prints like Roger L&#39;Estrange&#39;s The Committee (1680) demonstrating a growing sophistication in political commentary. In the reign of William and Mary, Dutch satires of British politics circulated, often produced by Romeyn de Hooghe (1645-1708), who is well represented in the database. Graphic satire acquired a potency which anticipated the age of Gillray a century later. </p></div></div>',1),Zs={class:"text-center"};function Xs(e,a,t,i,r,n){const l=(0,o.up)("HomeLink"),s=(0,o.up)("HomeBanner"),d=(0,o.up)("NavMenu"),c=(0,o.up)("SimpleFooter");return(0,o.wg)(),(0,o.iD)("div",Vs,[(0,o.Wm)(l),(0,o.Wm)(s),(0,o.Wm)(d),Os,(0,o._)("section",Qs,[Ys,(0,o._)("div",Zs,[(0,o._)("a",{href:"#",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...e)=>n.viewResourcesPage&&n.viewResourcesPage(...e)),class:"bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 mt-4 mb-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline inline-flex items-center w-40"},"Back to Resources ")])]),(0,o.Wm)(c)])}var $s={data(){return{}},components:{HomeLink:Be,HomeBanner:y,NavMenu:A,SimpleFooter:Le},methods:{viewResourcesPage(){this.$router.push("/resources")}}};const ed=(0,d.Z)($s,[["render",Xs]]);var ad=ed,td=t.p+"img/thm_engravingetching.e0dd6004.jpg",id=t.p+"img/thm_woodcutting.ab433d51.jpg",rd=t.p+"img/thm_turnerplate.195c87e1.jpg",od=t.p+"img/thm_engravingtools.85807c0a.jpg",nd=t.p+"img/thm_pouringaquafortis.dfddafd8.jpg",ld=t.p+"img/thm_greatexecutioner.d0c7bb9e.jpg",sd=t.p+"img/thm_bosseprinting.8373c98e.jpg";const dd={class:"relative container mx-auto px-20 bg-gray-200"},cd=(0,o.uE)('<section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white pt-12 pb-6 lg:px-8"><p class="text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-indigo-600">Introducing</p><h1 class="mt-2 mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Techniques</h1><span class="float-right pl-6"><img src="'+td+'"></span><p class="py-4 text-left">Printing is the transferral of ink from a prepared surface (block, plate, or stone) onto paper or other material.

Woodblocks were used in Europe from the 13th century, with the first prints on paper appearing in the late-14th. </p><p class="py-4">IBlocks were made from soft wood around an inch thick. The design would be drawn on it (or on paper glued to the surface). A woodcutter would cut away the areas around the lines of the design before applying ink to the remaining raised area using a dabber. The image was transferred to paper by stamping it by hand, by rubbing the back of paper laid on top of the block, or, from the 1450s onwards, by use of a press. Because the presses were also used for movable type, it was possible to print images and letterpress text together on a single page of a book. This was not possible in the intaglio processes. Despite this advantage, woodcuts declined in the 17th century relative to intaglio prints that could produce finer and more precise images. </p><p class="py-4">Distinguishing a woodcut from one of the other techniques is straightforward. A woodcut will lack a platemark (the mark around the edges of intaglio prints); lines are more likely to be uneven when compared to intaglio prints; and by it is possible to see that lines have been achieved by cutting around them.</p><span class="float-right pl-6"><img src="'+rd+'"></span></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Engraving</h2><div class="mt-4 text-left"><span class="float-left pr-6"><img src="'+od+'"></span><p class="py-4">Engraved prints date from the 15th century. Engraving involved cutting a design into a copper plate using a burin, a small steel rod with a sharpened V-shaped point. The completed design consisted of a series of incised lines on the copper plate. </p><p class="py-4">After warming the plate, ink was applied and worked into the lines. Ink on the plate&#39;s surface area was then carefully wiped off and the plate was then placed face up in an intaglio press. A sheet of dampened paper was placed on top of it and cloths placed on top of both to even out the pressure when the plate passed through the press&#39;s rollers. The pressure of the rollers forced the paper into the plate&#39;s grooves, dragging out the ink. The paper was then hung up to dry and the plate re-inked for a further impression. The pressure of the press caused the platemark, the indented line where the edge of the plate was pushed into the paper. </p><p class="py-4">Engravings can be distinguished from woodcuts by inspecting the ink, which is usually slightly raised on the paper because of the paper dragging the ink up when passed through the press. Engravings can be identified by the steadiness of the lines, and the fine points at the beginning of lines as the burin is first pushed into the plate and at the end as it is lifted from the plate. </p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Etching</h2><div class="mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left"><span class="float-right pr-6"><img src="'+nd+'"></span><p class="py-4">Etched prints date from the early 16th century. Etching involved cutting lines into a copper print using acid (rather than a burin, as in engraving). The entire plate was covered evenly with a melted acid-resistant wax ground. After this had cooled and hardened, the etcher used a needle to draw lines through the ground and expose the copper underneath (this was a less laborious than engraving directly into copper). The plate was then immersed in acid which ate into those parts of the plate exposed by the etched lines (which became deeper the longer the plate was immersed). The ground was then removed, and impressions were made from the plate using an intaglio press in the same way as engravings. </p><p class="py-4">Etchings can be distinguished from engravings by the relative unevenness of their lines caused by the acid not biting evenly. Engraved lines are more formal than etched lines, which often resemble the greater freedom of drawing.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6"><div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Mezzotint</h2><div class="mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left"><span class="float-left pr-6"><img src="'+ld+'"></span><p class="py-4">Mezzotints date from the mid-17th century. The technique is credited to a German soldier, Ludwig von Siegen, in 1642. The first mezzotints were produced by Prince Rupert in the 1650s. The technique was widely known by the 1660s. </p><p class="py-4">Unlike engraving and etching, in mezzotint the engraver worked from dark to light. First a rocker (a blade with teeth) was used to roughen the plate. A plate inked in this rough state it would print a rich black. The engraver created the design by smoothing out parts of the plate with a scraper/burnisher. The smoother the area, the less ink it held, and tones could be created: light burnishing of an area printed dark grey, heavy scraping light grey. Inking the plate was a complex task. The printing process that followed was the same as for engravings/etchings. Because they were highly worked mezzotint plates became worn by press more quickly than engravings or etchings, and it was not uncommon for the printmaker to rework the plate during the printing process. </p><p class="py-4">Mezzotints are distinguishable from the other engravings, etching, and woodcuts because of their absence of lines and their tonal quality. The different techniques in the intaglio process could be combined on a single plate: mezzotints often had areas of engraved detail, and many engravers first etched background detail onto a plate before continuing to engrave the design.</p></div></div></section>',5),hd={class:"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 pb-6"},pd=(0,o.uE)('<div class="mx-auto max-w-6xl text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 bg-white px-6 py-4 lg:px-8"><h2 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl text-left">Printing, states and impressions</h2><div class="mt-4 max-w-6xl text-left"><span class="float-right pr-6"><img src="'+sd+'"></span><p class="py-4">The printing matrix (block/plate) could be re-used numerous times, either to create more impressions, or, after reworking, different states. </p><p class="py-4">Blocks or plates had almost limitless states. These were the result of some alteration, whether minor reworking or significant re-engraving: indeed, an entire metal plate could be smoothed down and re-used for a completely different image. Woodblocks were more durable than metal plates. Repeated printings eventually wore down copper plates which printmakers had to rework during the process to maintain the image&#39;s quality. This applied particularly to mezzotints. A different state of a print often resulted from this reworking of the plate. </p><p class="py-4">Proofs were another common example of a different state. Several proofs could be made before the final published state was reached, each a way of checking the progress of the design. The most common proofs are prints before lettering was added. Lettering was often added to a print by a specialist lettering engraver and could be extensive, including mottos, scriptural references, a title, explanatory verses, and details of a print&#39;s designer (or the artist after whom the design was taken), engraver, and publisher.

He also designed sets of prints of birds and animals which were etched by Wenceslaus Hollar, Richard Gaywood and others.

Initially, his prints were published by Edward Cooper and Alexander Browne, but by 1686 he had set up his own business. His signed mezzotints are mostly portraits, particularly after paintings by Willem Wissing and Godfrey Kneller, though he also published landscapes and genre subjects. He died in 1688, leaving the field open to his pupil, John Smith, who took over his relationship with Kneller and much of his stock. </p></div></div><h2 id="accordion-collapse-heading-3"><button type="button" class="flex items-center justify-between w-full p-5 font-medium rtl:text-right text-gray-500 border border-gray-200 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 gap-3" data-accordion-target="#accordion-collapse-body-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion-collapse-body-3"><span class="text-2xl">Blooteling, Abraham der </span><svg data-accordion-icon class="w-3 h-3 rotate-180 shrink-0" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 10 6"><path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M9 5 5 1 1 5"></path></svg></button></h2><div id="accordion-collapse-body-3" class="hidden" aria-labelledby="accordion-collapse-heading-3"><div class="p-5 border border-t-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 text-left"><p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-left"> (1614-?66) Van der Borcht was the son of a man of the same name who had fled from the Netherlands to Germany, where he was trained partly by his father and partly by Matthaüs Merian, through whom he probably met Hollar.

By 1652 he had returned to England where he set up a successful business which he continued for the rest of his life, though increasingly his activity was as a dealer rather than an engraver. At his best, Faithorne could produce very sensitive engraved portraits; however, he was increasingly overshadowed by younger artists from the 1660s onwards.

However, in 1644 he was forced into exile in Antwerp, where he remained for several years (though many of the works that he executed were for the English market). He returned to England in 1652 and thereafter was involved in a variety of publishing projects, not least those initiated by Sir William Dugdale and John Ogilby.

Hind to an &#39;Anonymous Engraver, c.1600-10&#39;, <sup>i</sup>and surviving only in a later impression in the British Museum and the Houghton Library, Harvard, with the address of the late seventeenth-century publisher, John Garrett. Recently Antony Griffiths firmly attributed it to the engraver Renold Elstrack, born c.1570 and last heard of in 1625. He further noted that the printseller Thomas Jenner was advertising it as part of his stock in 1662 as <span class="italic">The Ridinge of the Asse</span>, and that it must have passed, on his death eleven years later, to Garrett (as did most of the rest of Jenner&#39;s stock). As Griffiths cogently remarks, &#39;That only two impressions survive of a print that remained in production for so long is entirely typical of early British printmaking&#39;. <sup>ii</sup>Elstrack is also known as the engraver of at least one other broadside satire, the traditional misogynist <span class="italic">Bulchin</span> and <span class="italic">Thingut</span>.<sup>iii</sup></p><p class="py-2">Perhaps not altogether surprisingly, given what little we know of Elstrack&#39;s family origins, his engraving derives quite closely from an early sixteenth-century German woodcut of which an impression survives in the Douce print collection at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, though not the speeches given to the various representatives of society who struggle to ride the ass. <sup>iv</sup>Evidently a fairly well-known motif in Germany, it is found, for example, on one of the biscuit-moulds (dated 1517) belonging to Claus Stalburg the Rich, Mayor of Frankfurt, who catalogued it thus: <span class="italic">Der 16. stain ist das eselryten, und will eyn iglicher der allernest seyn</span> [The 16th stone (biscuit-mould) is Riding the Ass, and everyone wants to be the very next].<sup>v</sup></p><p class="py-2"> In graphic art it reappears roughly a century later in Peter Rollos&#39; print-book aimed at the <span class="italic">alba amicorum</span> student market, the <span class="italic">Philotheca Corneliana</span> (Berlin, 1619), the [plate] itself being pasted onto f.101v. of the album of …. Henfenfelden [ Bamberg …. </p><p class="py-2"> The German woodcut print is untitled, but the full title of Elstrack&#39;s version - <span class="italic">Whilst maskinge in their follies all doe passe/ Though all say nay yet all doe ride the asse -</span> probably accurately reflects the intention of the original composition, i.e. it is a general, rather than a particular, satire, in which, with the exception of the judge (<span class="italic">Mr Justice</span> - though the verse explains that his motives for declining to ride are selfish), all social ranks and types of early Jacobean society (including the prostitute <span class="italic">Dame Punke, Don Pandar, Don Gull and a Gallant</span>) are associated with asinine folly (cf. the similar message of <span class="italic">Doctor Panurgus</span>, which will be discussed next month). All &#39;ride the ass&#39;, that is, everyone is foolish, though they even squabble about this. With this usage, compare the title-page woodcut to <span class="italic">The Fool&#39;s Complaint to Gotham College</span> (1643) depicting a fool riding on an ass which says, <span class="italic">The fool rides me</span>. Though seemingly unrecorded elsewhere, Robert Burton appears to use the idiom in precisely the same sense and context in his vastly learned <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy (1621): that they may go &#39;ride the ass&#39;, and all sail along ... in the &#39;ship of fools&#39;.<sup>vi</sup></span> Burton shows an awareness of pictorial prints throughout his book, referring earlier in passing to the fact that <span class="italic">all the world is mad... it is (which Epicthonius Cosmopolites expressed not many years since in a map) made like a fool&#39;s head (with that motto, Caput helleboro dignum).<sup>vii</sup></span></p><p class="py-2">A late seventeenth- or perhaps early eighteenth-century engraver revived and revised Elstrack&#39;s composition to illustrate another sheet entitled, <span class="italic">The ass age, or the world in hieroglyphick.

As well as paintings and etchings, he is known to have produced at least five mezzotints in the early 1680s. <sup>ii</sup> It is possible that he engraved the present print himself, or it might have been engraved by John Smith (who engraved others after paintings by Laroon), who may also have been the publisher. </p><p class="py-2">Laroon was best-known in his own time—as now—for his Dutch-style genre scenes of &#39;low life&#39;, a fact that led to a disapproving assessment of his work by the appropriately-named Vertue: &#39;His thoughts in his pictures shew him to be a Man of levity, of loose conversation &amp; morals suteable to his birth &amp; education, being low &amp; spurious.&#39;<sup>iii</sup> But it is time we addressed ourselves to the subject of this print. Quite what is going on exactly, in this apparently uniquely surviving impression of a late seventeenth-century English mezzotint? Is it intentionally pornographic? I feel certain it is, but also that it is not without a hint of satire. And what of the title and caption—<span class="italic">The Cully Flaug&#39;d</span> and <span class="italic">…Flaug the Fumblers Thighs?</span></p><p class="py-2"> There is no doubt that &#39;flaug&#39; is merely a phonetic variant of &#39;flog&#39;, as we now spell the word in Standard English, but, surprisingly, at the date this print was produced, the verb was still very new to the language—OED&#39;s first citation is from Coles&#39;s <span class="italic">English Dictionary</span> (1676) <sup>iv</sup> where it is defined as to whip, but marked as a cant word. Published in 1680, Tell-Troth&#39;s <span class="italic">Knavery of Astrology</span> claims that &#39;of late years there&#39;s a neat <span class="italic">Invention</span>, called <span class="italic">Flogging</span>, invented on purpose to pleasure <span class="italic">Old Fumblers</span>.&#39; </p><p class="py-2"> The caption—far from being the hackwork such labels are often considered—is a masterpiece of condensed wit. Consider the word <span class="italic">Insurrection</span> alone—the artist shows us a world in which a youngish woman, hardly more than a girl, can beat an elderly man, as if a reversal of the schoolmaster birching the naughty pupil: this is the revolution of the World Turned Upside Down—albeit at his sexual prompting—and given the suggestive import of the final line of the caption it is impossible not to hear <span class="italic">erection</span> in the word too. </p><p class="py-2"> Significantly, the elderly man in our print is also termed a <span class="italic">Fumbler</span>, defined in B.E&#39;s <span class="italic">New Dictionary of the Canting Crew</span> (1699) as &#39;an unperforming Husband, one that is insufficient&#39;, echoing the alternative title of <span class="italic">The Contented Cuckold</span> ballad (1686), &#39;the fortunate fumbler… he being insufficient to perform&#39;. In the 1678 edition of Ray&#39;s <span class="italic">A Collection of English Proverbs</span> the expression, &#39;He is free of Fumbler&#39;s Hall&#39;, is glossed, &#39;Spoken of a man that cannot get his wife with child&#39;. The <span class="italic">fumbler</span>, then, is certainly an infertile man, and often an impotent one too. The caption to our print with its innuendo couched in terms of conjuring up the Devil clearly suggests that the elderly man is unable to achieve an erection without being thrashed in this manner. </p><p class="py-2"> OED&#39;s citation at &#39;flauging&#39;—curiously given a separate entry in the Dictionary—and its unnecessarily cautious definition, ? = &#39;flogging&#39;, has at least the merit of being highly apposite to our print: it is from the opening scene of D&#39;Urfey&#39;s <span class="italic">Injured Princess</span> (1682): &#39;Ask him if he knows where we may find a sound Wench: he&#39;s a flauging old Whipster, I warrant him&#39; (with &#39;whipster&#39; being defined as &#39;one addicted to whipping or flogging&#39;). Of even greater assistance to us here, however, is Gordon Williams&#39; <span class="italic">Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature</span> (London, 1994) which gives a separate entry to &#39;flogging cully&#39;, where it is defined as a &#39;whore&#39;s client who desires whipping&#39;, a term first found in Head&#39;s <span class="italic">Canting Academy </span>(1673), and it is from Williams that I take most of my remaining examples. B.E.&#39;s definition of &#39;flogging&#39; in his <span class="italic">New Dictionary of the Canting Crew</span> (1699) reads, &#39;a Naked Woman&#39;s whipping (with Rods) an Old (usually)… Lecher.&#39; In London Spy II (1698) Ned Ward describes an &#39;Old Leacher&#39; as being &#39;one of that <span class="italic">Classis</span> in the <span class="italic">Black-School</span> of <span class="italic">Sodomy</span>, who are call&#39;d… <span class="italic">Flogging Cullies</span>. This <span class="italic">Unnatural Beast</span> gives Money to…<span class="italic">Strumpets</span>… and they down with his Breeches and Scourge his Privities till they have laid his <span class="italic">Leachery</span>.&#39; </p><p class="py-2">Though Ward described this penchant for flagellation as a &#39;new Vice&#39;, it had, in fact, already been described in an epigram, <span class="italic">In Francum</span>, published a century earlier in the late 1590s by Sir John Davies:</p><pre>        When Francus comes to sollace with his whoore\n        He sends for rods and strips himselfe stark naked:\n        For his lust sleepes, and will not rise before,\n        By whipping of the wench it be awaked.\n        </pre><p class="py-2">And what of the scene of this little drama? It hardly seems correct to call it a &#39;domestic interior&#39;; it is much too sparsely furnished for that: perhaps it is rather a room in what contemporaries referred to as a &#39;flogging school&#39;, i.e. a brothel specialising in flagellation. In his <span class="italic">London Terrae Filius</span> (1707) Ned Ward describes a whore &#39;who shall handle a <span class="italic">Birch-Rod</span> with e&#39;er a Pedagogue in <span class="italic">Christendom…</span> Mistress of a <span class="italic"></span>Flogging-School, where a parcel of Old <span class="italic">Fanatical Goats</span> go to be Whip&#39;d into their Leachery.&#39;</p><p class="py-2">The elderly gentleman&#39;s hat lies on the table beside a jug of wine and glass and—surely significant—a couple of coins. He is presumably paying for this particular specialist service, confirming that we are in a brothel chamber. But is the hat of any particular type that allows us to identify his profession? Is he a clergyman, for example? A schoolmaster? One can almost see the tabloid headlines! </p><p class="py-2">This impression appears to be a unique survivor and such subject-matter is always prey to later censorship by destruction, however popular in its own time, as late seventeenth-century auction catalogues from which I take the following lot descriptions would seems to suggest [Wing nos. in brackets]: an <span class="italic">old Cully flog&#39;d by Larroon</span> (13th Jan 1692, lot 161) [C7662], and a <span class="italic">Flogging-piece after Laroon</span> (15th Sept 1690, lot 187) [C5130], and, though unattributed, <span class="italic">The Cully well flogged</span> (30th April 1690, lot 707) [C5126], and a <span class="italic">Woman flogging a Cully </span>(Easter 1691, lot 63) [G1750].</p><p class="py-2">If we can agree to label this print by that contentious term &#39;pornographic&#39;, then it is one of the earliest such to survive from England. Inasmuch as the post-Restoration era enjoyed an apparently greater freedom when it came to publishing &#39;literary&#39; erotica, it appears to have enjoyed a somewhat more relaxed attitude to visual erotica too—and yet, and yet… Given the peculiar vulnerability of this category of art—visual as well as literary—we should exercise the greatest caution when attempting to assess the range and availability, quantity and quality of early modern &#39;erotic&#39; art.</p><p class="py-2">In <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> (1633) one of the many evils the Puritan William Prynne inveighed against were &#39;obscene pictures&#39;— not to mention, lascivious songs, bonfires, grand Christmases, long hair and laughter. <sup>v</sup> Puritans like Prynne had time (and censorship) on their side; in the sense in which we understand the term in the early twenty-first century, it is arguable that only one other example of visual pornography of native manufacture from this period has survived (see below).</p><p class="py-2">Throughout the period with which we are concerned, there would seem to have been relatively little &#39;homegrown&#39; material, so—as until relatively recent times—those interested in acquiring images of a pornographic nature turned naturally to the Continent. In Vanbrugh&#39;s <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (first staged in 1675), having just returned from France, Horner significantly claims, &#39;I have brought over not so much as a Bawdy Picture, new Postures nor the second part of the Escholle des Filles&#39;. <sup>vi</sup> In the very same year a group of Oxford undergraduates was discovered clandestinely trying to run off copies of these same <span class="italic">Postures</span> on the Clarendon Press at night. <sup>vii</sup> The six <span class="italic">French Postures</span> advertised for sale in Jenner&#39;s 1662 list are intriguing but their appearance unknown, and perhaps quite innocent—unlike the <span class="italic">10 Drawings of several postures</span> offered at the sale of John Dunstall&#39;s library in 1693.</p><p class="py-2">As for Horner&#39;s <span class="italic">Escholle des Filles</span>, originally published in Paris in 1655 (and unillustrated), it was read in the original by Samuel Pepys in 1668 and then burnt, &#39;that it might not be among my books to my shame&#39;. The illustrated English translation, published anonymously as <span class="italic">The School of Venus</span> in 1680, survives uniquely in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Opposite the title-page is an etched frontispiece entitled <span class="italic">The Schoole of Venus</span> which depicts a modestly-dressed woman standing behind a booth selling dildoes, while two potential buyers appear to be discussing the relative merits of those on offer and a third woman (a maid?) makes as if to tear her hair out in horror! <sup>viii</sup> Even more extraordinary is the survival of no fewer than twelve mezzotint illustrations accompanying the two Dialogues of <span class="italic">The School of Venus</span>, the crudity of which tends to confirm an English publication for the edition, <sup>ix</sup> but which also constitute surely the closest we shall ever come to an early modern English version of Aretine&#39;s <span class="italic">Postures</span>. </p><h4 class="py-2 text-xl font-bold">Footnotes</h4><ul class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside"><li class="py-2">OED sense 4: &#39;To beat, whip, lash, trounce, drub&#39;, citing <cite>British Apollo</cite> No. 9. 3/1 (1708), <cite>Who Bound up a tingling Rod, and firk&#39;d his Tail</cite>, and Ainsworth&#39;s <cite>Latin Dictionary</cite> (1736) in which <span class="italic">To firk</span> is glossed <span class="italic">flagello</span>. </li><li class="py-2">A.

Sheppard in the Lewis-Walpole Library, Farmington, Connecticut. </p><p class="py-2">The present Overton sheet dramatically presents the feline fortress centre-stage, with flags flying from its turrets, a bell tower and a cupola with a rat being hanged from a protruding mast. In it stands <span class="italic">Maister Tybet [sic] prince of Cat[s]</span>, who proclaims: </p><pre>        My command is to you all\n        To kill the Rats both great &amp; smal\n        </pre><p class="py-2">continuing:</p><pre>        Downe with the Rouges [sic] defend me now or never\n        If they get up we are undon for ever.\n        </pre><p class="py-2"> However, the castle is the subject of a formidable assault by its rodent adversaries, with ladders set up against its walls, cannons on every side and several phalanxes of attackers advancing, including a group approaching from the bottom left in a boat with the legend: </p><pre>        Fight ou [sic] brave Rats and kill our mortall foes\n        We&#39;ll fight it out nor Will we feare thair blowes\n        </pre><p class="py-2">while in the centre a cannon is being fired to cries of:</p><pre>        Your commistion [sic] is to kill and destroy\n        Mischevous Cats that doe your state annoy.\n        </pre><p class="py-2">Above this is a gallows where a rat is hanging a cat with the legend: <span class="italic">up you goe Mistriss puse</span>, and another cat is having a noose put round her neck. Below are two scenes which appear inset in rectangular frames (though, in fact, only one may properly be so called — close inspection shows that it is the pole of the banner which forms the apparent lefthand margin of the scenes). These apparently inset scenes perhaps adumbrate the comic-strip presentation of later versions; the &#39;upper scene&#39; shows two rats reading the letter of commission with its pendent seals, while the &#39;lower&#39; one, showing a band of eight rats armed with halberds and spears held aloft, is captioned,</p><pre>        if wee these catcs [sic] can overcom and kill\n        of cheese and Bacon we shall have our fill.\n        </pre><p class="py-2">This literary humour is reflected in details of the image — the rats&#39; banners displaying cheeses and hams, while the flags flown from the cats&#39; castle bear fish (three fish in the earliest-known German woodcut of c.1500, and also in the late seventeenth-century English version where they appear above the legend <span class="italic">Herrings for ever</span>, while the ensign which flutters from the stern of <span class="italic">The Royal Rat</span> depicts two rats either side of a large circular cheese over the motto, <span class="italic">Cheshire Cheese for ever</span>).</p><p class="py-2">The names of the two battle-leaders on the present sheet perhaps suggest derivation from some French version (<span class="italic">Tybert</span>—spelled correctly in the Library of Congress impression—and <span class="italic">Nigro Musell</span>, perhaps Black Snout, the latter element from Old French <span class="italic">musel</span>, snout), and yet in an early seventeenth-century French version of <span class="italic">La grande &amp; merueilleuse Bataille, d&#39;entre les Chats, &amp; les Rats</span>, which bears the imprint <span class="italic">A Lyon pour Leonard Odet; au coin de rue Ferrandiere</span>, 1610, the prince des Chatz is named <span class="italic">Mitou</span>, while in a later seventeenth-century version, closer in composition to the present example, issued by Pierre Bertrand in Paris and entitled <span class="italic">Le Fort des Chatz assiege par les Ratz</span>, he is named <span class="italic">Raminagrobis </span>(probably the source of the name of La Fontaine&#39;s feline hero). It is curious that it is the English sheet rather than the French one which uses the name <span class="italic">Tibert</span> for the cats&#39; leader. Deriving from the name given to the cat in the medieval French beast-epic, the <span class="italic">Roman de Renart</span>, it was certainly familiar to the Elizabethans and lies behind Mercutio&#39;s punning reference to <span class="italic">Tybalt</span> as <span class="italic">King of Cats in Romeo &amp; Juliet</span> (III.i.76), and Nashe&#39;s contemporary reference to <span class="italic">Tibault...Prince of Cats</span> in <span class="italic">Have with you to Saffron Walden</span> (1596). By the time of the late eighteenth-century English sheets, the protagonists are the less colourfully-named <span class="italic">King Mew</span> and <span class="italic">Prince Squeak</span>.</p><p class="py-2">Though all European versions of the print bear a close generic resemblance, telltale details in the English version suggest it derives immediately (in reverse) from a Dutch model. <sup>iii</sup></p><p class="py-2">The originators of the prints have left the siege in the balance—from the images it is not possible to guess the outcome—but the lengthy verse text accompanying the Lyon version, at least, makes it clear that the cats, who are explicitly said to represent great villains <span class="italic">[gros larrons]</span>, successfully defend the castle and the few surviving rats, representing the lesser villains <span class="italic"></span> are forced to flee. The earliest known version similarly leaves the outcome of the siege undecided, but we are given some orientation as to how to read this provocative image from the couplet</p><pre>        disi figur get alle di an\n        dy iren obristen under sta[n]\n        </pre><p class="py-2">This image refers to all those who are subject to their superiors</p><p class="py-2">Though even this in its ambiguity—tautology, indeed!—gets us no further, though German commentators have noted the popular peasant movements in late fifteenth-century Germany associated with such names as the <span class="italic">Bundschuh</span>, and a little later, <span class="italic">Armer Konrad</span>. At the time our present print was issued, the tragic upheaval of the English Civil War was still fresh in the memory, and it is quite possible that an earlier (lost) version—or, just possibly, the very version without imprint in the Library of Congress—had been issued in the 1630s or 1640s. But while there is some reason to believe that the rats storming the cats&#39; castle was sometimes capable of a political interpretation, it seems that for the majority of viewers most of the time it was a purely humorous image.</p><p class="py-2">The Bowles &amp; Carter version, London, c.1790, has verse captions as follows:</p><pre>        As the Cats had been long the Rats&#39; foes\n        The latter resolv&#39;d to oppose\n        So by Land and by Sea in a throng\n        They scratch and they quarrel ding dong\n        And over their foes to prevail\n        Some fire and some the Walls scale\n        Yet how it will end we can&#39;t say\n        But see the fight out and you may.\n        King Mew his commission bestows\n        to murder all Rats as his foes.\n        Prince Squeak gives his orders with joy\n        All Enemy Cats to destroy.\n        A Squadron of rats sally out\n        to put all the Cats to the rout.\n        The Pussies when taken are banged\n        Drawn quarter&#39;d beheaded &amp; hang&#39;d. \n        </pre><h4 class="py-2 text-xl font-bold">Footnotes</h4><ul class="list-[lower-roman] list-inside"><li class="py-2">For the anterior history of the motif, found in wall-painting from the twelfth century, see Malcolm Jones, <cite>The Secret Middle Ages </cite>(Stroud, 2002), p. 148. </li><li class="py-2">available at http://www.diceyandmarshall.bham.ac.uk/refframe.htm</li><li class="py-2">A sixteenth-century two-block woodcut print, of which the right-hand half only survives in an eighteenth-century impression, reproduced in E.H. van Heurck and G.J.

But as the young man, prey to multifarious follies and devoted to fashionable fads and fancies, has long been the target of the moralists&#39; especial wrath, and the <span class="italic">saeva indignatio</span> of the satirists, the follies of dissolute youth are what I take to be the principal subject of this puzzling sheet which, as Griffiths notes, &#39;has a complicated ancestr&#39;.<sup>i</sup></p><p class="pb-2">The costume of the figures would seem to date to the 1620s, and this agrees with the known dates of activity of the engraver, Martin Droeshout, who has signed the sheet with his monogram: <span class="italic">MD sculpsit</span>. The earliest state of the present print to survive, however, was probably issued in the 1650s, bearing Peter Stent&#39;s imprint alone, and is held in the Wellcome Institute collection. <sup>ii</sup></p><p class="pb-2">The composition derives from a print engraved by Matthaus Greuter, probably c.1600 (itself deriving from one of the emblems in the de Brys&#39; hugely influential <span class="italic">Emblemata Saecularia</span> of 1596), which was issued in French/German and German-only editions, the former bearing the title <span class="italic">Le medecin guarissant Phantasie Purgeant aussi Par drogues la folie</span> [The doctor curing fantasies, and also purging folly with drugs]. But Droeshout made significant changes to his model, dropping the doctor&#39;s assistant, adding a richly-dressed couple, an inset panel in which two pluralists confront each other weighed down by the churches on their shoulders, and a great deal of explanatory text in the form of labels within the image-frame.</p><p class="pb-2">Naming the wonder-working doctor <span class="italic">Panurgus</span> seems to have been Droeshout&#39;s innovation. Why? It is unlikely Droeshout had read Rabelais - most English intellectuals knew only the French author&#39;s name, which they used, like those of Aretino and Machiavelli, merely as a hate-word. <span class="italic">Panourgia</span> is a medical term, and Galen uses it for &#39;adulterated or false drugs&#39;, and although the etymological sense of the name is neutrally &#39;all-work&#39;, later English usage similarly tended to interpret the term pejoratively as &#39;ready to do any work&#39;, i.e. including illegal things, as a criminal would be. Notwithstanding this, however, there is no doubt that in our print Dr. Panurgus is a <span class="italic">positive</span> figure, able to cure his patients, who come from all ranks of society - as the verses and the figures themselves make clear - of their manifold follies. Significantly, for dating purposes, the Latinate form of the name - which by itself suggests independence of Rabelais&#39; creation - is known to have been used by two English writers in 1619 and 1623 only, and perhaps strengthens the case for an origin in the 1620s. <sup>iii</sup></p><p class="pb-2">From the copious inscription text I excerpt a few salient points.</p><p class="pb-2">Though concentrating on the foibles and follies of the gallant, who is by definition youthful, the verse makes clear that the <span class="italic">Millions</span> who resort to the Doctor come from <span class="italic">Cuntry, Citty &amp; the Court</span> - i.e. that folly is no respecter of a person&#39;s rank or origins. By his Waters <span class="italic">Drugges ,Conserves &amp; Potions</span>, the Doctor <span class="italic"></span>purgeth fancies follies, Idle motions, many of which are detailed in the verses below the image, but also visualised in the phantasmagoria that escapes from the <span class="italic">Gallants Fornace</span>. The Doctor is currently pouring a dose labelled <span class="italic"></span>Wisdome and Understanding down the throat of a <span class="italic">rude Rustical</span>l who sits on a close-stool and through whom <span class="italic">passe</span> various animals and birds, including an ass, which is being milked by a man (in the German original only three little fools are excreted). The Doctor informs us that taking the <span class="italic">Gallants Braine</span> out and washing it had proved ineffective, but now, subliming his head in the furnace has yielded <span class="italic">good Successe</span> - in the form of the <span class="italic">Strange Chimaera-Crotchetts</span> visible in the smoke above. They are later referred to as both <span class="italic">Projects and ayrie Castles</span> - i.e. &#39;castles in the air&#39;, cf. from Burton&#39;s contemporary <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1621): <span class="italic">That castle in the ayr, that crochet, that whimsie <sup>iv</sup></span> - and include cards, dice, backgammon-board, tobacco-pipes, violin, tennis, masks, feathers, plumed hat, swords, a dressed ape, a woman with a fan, a man teaching a horse to perform tricks, a bear-baiting, a boy flying a kite, a man with wings strapped to his shoulders (attempt at human flight? No Elizabethan/Jacobean candidate known to me, though doubtless they existed - for a while...), a man sliding down a rope from the tower of (Old) St. Paul&#39;s (a popular contemporary feat), jug and goblet, limed branch for bird-catching, a man walking a pair of hounds, and a fencer (with wings). Most of these are copied from the German original - the interest for us lies chiefly in those which were not, and which we may thus reasonably consider peculiarly English: they include the bear-baiting, the tobacco-pipes, <sup>v</sup> the St. Paul&#39;s rope-slider and the horse being taught tricks - perhaps intended to be William Banks and his celebrated horse &#39;Marocco&#39;. </p><p class="pb-2">To the well-dressed lady with her fan and pet squirrel on a lead the Doctor says,</p><pre>        Once (faire) I knew the tongues Phlebotomie\n        Had powre to Cure your Sexes Maladie\n        But now youre manly humors boile so highe\n        That you must in the Gallants Fornace lye\n        </pre><p class="pb-2">which looks like a swipe at both the garrulity traditionally attributed to women, as well - interestingly - as evidencing a more contemporary Jacobean concern with manly women, as reflected for instance in the pamphlet, <span class="italic">Hic Mulier: or, The Man-Woman: Being a medicine to cure the Coltish Disease of the Staggers in the Masculine-Feminines of our Times </span>(1620). The verses claim she has even more <span class="italic">wandring Crotchets</span> than the gallant and lists them:</p><pre>        Steelettoes <sup>vi</sup>  girdles patches painted brests <sup>vii</sup>\n        Points <sup>viii</sup>  powders feathers washes <sup>ix</sup>  &amp; the rest\n        ... Haire breath Complexions all are borrowed ware.\n        </pre><p class="pb-2">The similarly well-dressed gentleman the Doctor addresses mockingly as <span class="italic">Sir Briske, spruce master Cittyzsinne</span>, in which the last, clearly eccentric spelling is presumably to point up a pun, as if he embodies the <span class="italic">City&#39;s sin</span>. <sup>x</sup> Though, like his lady, he looks more like a courtier than a tradesman - which has led to much complicated historical speculation, principally that the pair are the Countess of Essex and her lover the Earl of Somerset - the contemporary label identifies one of the ingredients of the potion the Doctor will administer as <span class="italic">plaine dealing</span>, and one of the things it will expel as <span class="italic">couzening weights</span>. But perhaps it is precisely part of this upstart citizen&#39;s presumption that, though a mere tradesman, he apes the dress of the gentry. In the probably contemporary sheet, <span class="italic">The Common Weales Canker Worms or the Locusts both of Church, and States</span>, the Merchant similarly says, <span class="italic">I cosen these foure</span> [i.e the four preceding characters] and his inset emblem is a pair of scales and a yardstick with the motto, <span class="italic">libris et labris lucror furtiuis</span> [I gain by fraudulent scales and measures], while in the verse beneath the engraving, he says, <span class="italic">Ile ease your purses with a trick of skill/While mine with waights &amp; measures false I fill</span>.</p><p class="pb-2">Inset into our engraving is a panel - seemingly not a later addition - depicting two divines confronting each other, both with churches on their backs which cause them to stoop, and one of whom carries a second church in his arms. It is tempting to suggest that the square frame in which these pluralists are depicted, and which appears to interrupt the composition, is a post-Droeshout interpolation, perhaps c.1642, when the motif was current (and which is also the earliest known date of Peter Stent&#39;s activity as a print-publisher). <sup>xi</sup></p><p class="pb-2">It is captioned</p><pre>        Who bore two Churches &amp; complaind of none\n        Nowe being purged findes too much of one.  \n        </pre><p class="pb-2">If this pluralists panel is original, however, we can certainly point to the existence of the iconographic motif this early, for it features prominently in <a href="#">The Mappe of the Man of Sinne</a> issued in 1622. Indeed, it might provide a useful dating indication for the <span class="italic">Panurgus</span> print, as the <span class="italic">Nowe</span> of the caption perhaps suggests some topical ecclesiastical legislation.</p><p class="pb-2">There may well be a &#39;quotation&#39; from <span class="italic"></span>Doctor Panurgus in a print issued some fifty years later entitled <a href="#">The Committee; or Popery in Masquerade (1680)</a>. This holds up the various nonconformist sects for ridicule, including the Quakers; they are depicted as constituting a committee listening to petitions from a dog, a horse, a man and a woman. To the left, the various victims of the Civil War appear in chains, while on the right, a Church of England priest is forced to vomit forth his living - a detail which may well owe something to the fact that its designer, Sir Roger L&#39;Estrange, the most effective of the Tory propagandists at this period, was also the Restoration censor, and in that capacity had personally accorded <span class="italic">Doctor Panurgus</span> his imprimatur eight years earlier; indeed, the present impression (one of only three known) is signed and dated by him, <span class="italic">Licensed October 28 1692, Ro.

It is a superb large sheet entitled, The Embleme of Englands Distractions As also of her attained, and further expected Freedome, &amp; Happiness Per H M 1658. </p><p class="pb-2">Oliver stands holding a sword piercing three crowns upraised in one hand, an open book in the other, and tramples with one foot between the bare breasts of the prostrate Whore of Babylon, who pours the contents of her &#39;cup of abominations&#39; over a hydra-headed serpent labelled Error and Faction, which his other foot pins to the ground. Above his head are the dove bearing the olive branch of peace (which also puns on his name), and a glory, indicating divine approval. He stands, himself a pillar of the State, like a latter-day Hercules between two columns, on one of which allegorical figures representing England, Ireland and Scotland offer him laurel wreaths, while the other is composed of the fundamentals of English civil society, Magna Carta, the Rule of Law, etc. </p><p class="pb-2">Three Old Testament vignettes are placed above him: Noah&#39;s ark safely arriving through wind and wave (here steering a middle course between rocks anachronistically but Classically identified as Scylla and Charybdis!) to the top of Ararat on which the sun beams down&#39; an example of the popular metaphor of the Ship of State: Oliver has steered the Ship safely through the trials and tribulations (of Civil War), till it has now come to rest in the sunny uplands of divine favour. Somewhat more puzzling, however,&#39; even sinister&#39; is the third scene, the Sacrifice of Isaac, with Jacob his sword poised about to decapitate the boy&#39; surely this cannot allude to the beheading of Charles I some nine years earlier? The summit on which the terrible deed is about to be done is labelled Moria&#39; unless this Greek name (famously and punningly used by Sir Thomas More in his Encomium Moriae or Praise of Folly) was instead intended not as a place-name, but as an allusion to the folly of such an act?</p><p class="pb-2">The bottom of the sheet is filled with several emblematic scenes of peace and prosperity (left), and machinations against the state (right). A shepherd pipes to his sheep beneath another punning olive tree, labelled Oliva Pacis [&#39;the olive of peace&#39;, but also, &#39;Oliver&#39;s peace&#39;], and the Isaian prophecy, They shall beat their Speares into Pruneing-hooks And their Swords into Plow-shears, is illustrated by the peaceful occupations of cutting grape-bunches from an unconvincing, tree-like vine with a pruning-hook, and a man using a horse-drawn plough. Perhaps most interesting, however, is the last of these peaceful emblems, the war-helmet which has become used as a hive by bees; already 150 years old by this date, it first appears in England in Geoffrey Whitney&#39;s A Choice of Emblemes (1586), but there derives from Andrea Alciati&#39;s original emblem-book of 1531. Closer in date to Faithorne&#39;s print of Cromwell, it had also appeared in George Wither&#39;s Collection of Emblemes (1635). </p><p class="pb-2">In the bottom righthand corner of the sheet two bonneted Jesuits are depicted, one carrying a dark lantern, a man with bellows trying to set light to barrels of gunpowder, and Samson&#39;s trick of a pair of foxes yoked by the tails about to fire a cornfield&#39; some of which imagery recurs a few years later in another print entitled Pyrotechnica Loyalana, Ignatian fireworks (1667). A gallows with noose is labelled Proditorum finis funis [The rope is the end of traitors]. The gunpowder is placed within a cavern of the rock on which the righthand pillar featuring the representations of England, Scotland and Ireland stands, and is also attacked by a number of men (one with a dog&#39;s head) wielding pickaxes&#39; literal attempts to undermine the state, presumably. The final scene which remains mysterious to me, is of three rustics, one with pitchfork, approaching a small copse at the foot of the same rock. </p><p class="pb-2">Ironically, in the fifth state of the plate (1690), the head was changed to that of William of Orange, while the head of Queen Mary tops the lefthand pillar. </p><p class="pb-2">For an authoritative discussion of the various states of this engraving, see Antony Griffiths, The Print in Stuart Britain, 1603-89 (London, 1998), cat. no. 115.
