For a broadside with the same plate and letterpress on the 1680 procession, see 1849-3-15-69. (Text from Antony Griffiths, \'The Print in Stuart Britain\', BM 1998, cat.197) The solemn mock processions, held on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth\'s accession on 17 November over the three years from 1679-81, were carefully staged by the Whigs as part of their campaign to weaken the Tories and exclude James from the succession. The day had been marked by bonfires and burnings of the Pope in effigy since the early 1670\'s, but the event of 1679 was on a completely different scale. It must have cost the Whigs a very large sum, which was raised through subscriptions from the Party and by secret contributions from the French ambassador, Barillon, whose constant aim was to ensure that the King and Parliament were always at loggerheads (George p.46). Church bells awoke London at 3am. After fourteen hours of revelry, the procession itself began at 5pm, with the now dark city illuminated by fires and torches. It threaded its way through the streets of the City, past an estimated 500,000 spectators. The bulk of the crowd gathered at the end of the route, at the Whig headquarters at the Green Ribbon Club at the King\'s Head Tavern near Temple Bar, by the statue of Queen Elizabeth, where wine and beer were available free to anyone proclaiming their abhorrence of Popery. The print shows how apprentices cleared the way for an effigy of Justice Godfrey held by one of his murderers dressed as a Jesuit, who was followed by a procession of figures dressed in the habits of various Catholic orders, with the Pope himself at the end accompanied by the devil. At the end of the procession (top left) the dummy was thrown onto a pyre. (See S.Williams, \'The Pope-burning processions of 1679, 1680 and 1681\', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XXI 1958, pp.104-17.) This elaborate and well-engraved print was published in January 1680 as a commemoration and follow-up to the procession itself, as is shown by a long advertisement for it in the \'Domestic Intellegencer\' for 9 January which gives the price as 6d. The letterpress of the broadsheet gives two addresses \'at the King\'s Arms in the Poultry and at the Feathers in Lumbard Street near the Post Office\'. The first is of Dorman Newman, the second is is of Samuel Lee, who also published the broadsheet of the 1680 procession. A later advertisement in the \'Mercurius Civicus\' for 3 April 1680 gives the name of yet another publisher, Jonathan Wilkins at the Star in Cheapside. Although his name is not given, the design can be attributed with some confidence to Francis Barlow, who is known to have designed other anti-Papal prints. The engraver remains unidentified. For the Procession of 1680, another engraved broadsheet was produced by the same team (BMSat 1085). It shows the series of floats that were prepared with pageants of Popish devilry, and the design can be attributed with equal confidence to Barlow. The text implies that the print was sold during the procession itself, and an unillustrated pamphlet, \'The solemn mock-procession\', which advertises this print, was a product of the same propaganda machine (Williams p.106). Underneath the names of the three publishers is a note \'There will be no other true representation of this procession but this.\' This did not stop a rival engraving (BMSat 1084) being published by John Oliver in collaboration with two other publishers; George (p.53 n.2) very plausibly attributes it to Stephen College. Luttrell\'s annotation on his impression (now in the British Museum) shows that Oliver\'s print came out on 1 December, only a fortnight after the procession - an indication of how quickly a plate could be designed and engraved when necessary.","jpgNum":"333648.jpg"},{"id":7836,"title":"","description":"A satirical broadside on the Popish Plot and and its consequences with an etching showing the Pope in an elaborate bed, beside which a table contains a crucifix and papal accoutrements, alarmed by the arrival of a procession of ghosts in their shrouds.

It was one of the last attempts of the Whig propaganda machine to rally support, and shows the apotheosis of the four chief witnesses to the Plot (Oates, Prance, Dugdale and Bedloe) triumphing over the plotting of \'the infernall conclave\' of Papists. Although the engraver is unidentified (the manner appears to be of Robert White), the design is certainly by Barlow. His original drawing for the lower half of the design survives in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (first recognised and attributed by Richard Godfrey; see \'English caricature 1620 to the present\', Victoria & Albert Museum, 1984, cat.4). The publisher Benjamin Combe, at the Ball and Anchor in Lombard Street, is otherwise unknown, which suggests that he was a Whig agent. Barlow\'s work as a designer of satires has only recently become the subject of study (see Hodnett pp.26-33), for he never signed his work in this field. It is the surviving drawings that prove his involvement, and allow other attributions. His signed work of these years are the large natural history prints made for Pierce Tempest. But his patron William Cavendish, 4th Earl and later first Duke of Devonshire, to whom he dedicated the second edition of his Aesop in 1687 with an acknowledgement of \'Your Lordship\'s many favours towards me\', was a prominent Whig and a central figure in the attempt to exclude James from the succession. To the designs listed by Hodnett, Richard Godfrey has informed us that he would add two others on stylistic grounds: \'The Devill\'s Triumph over Rome\'s idoll\' (BMSat 1079), and \'The Dreadful apparition, or The Pope haunted with Ghosts\' (BMSat 1091).

It was later found among the prints after Holbein, and published in a note in \'Print Quarterly\' in XVII 2000, p.167. The print has been folded to form a letter addressed to van der Borcht on one side. On the verso is a letter which gives a valuable insight into the relationship between the two men (Hollar dedicated P.272 to him), and into Hollar\'s approach to his prints. \'According to the wish of your son Hendrick I am forwarding you a proof of this print, made in his presence. You must not think that this is a perfect proof, for I printed it immediately after removing it from the acid. The entire plate needs to be corrected against the original. I am therefore very unwilling to send the proof since I take care that no-one should see them until they have reached perfection. So what you see here is simply what the acid has done, and it still needs to be gone over again with the needle. Hendrick has gone to the country and sends you his greetings.

The drawing used was in Arundel\'s collection, and is related to a fresco by Giulio in the Casino della Grotta of the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. The son of Seleucus was condemned to be blinded as punishment for adultery; his father offered one of his own eyes in order to save one of his son\'s. (Arundel\'s drawing is now in the British Museum (Pp.2-94), but is an old copy rather than Giulio\'s original.) The significance of this print to Hollar is shown by its being found printed both in red ink (as here) and in blue (impression in Prague); this is quite exceptional.

Wenceslaus Hollar, the most prolific printmaker of his period and a refugee from his native Bohemia, spent many years years of his life in London in the service of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel (1585 - 1646 ) the great connoisseur and patron of the arts. Together with its pendant, a portrait of the artist\'s father, Albrecht DÃÂ¼rer the Elder of 1497(London, National Gallery; Anzelewsky 48) DÃÂ¼rer\'s self-portrait had been presented in 1636 by the city of Nuremberg to King Charles I. through the Earl of Arundel. The Earl had stopped in the city that year, while leading an embassy to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II in Vienna from the English king. The inscription along the lower edge of Hollar\'s print indicates that it was made in Antwerp in 1645, after a painting in the collection of the Earl of Arundel. Hollar has faithfully transcribed DÃÂ¼rer\'s monogram and the date on the window-sill and added DÃÂ¼rer\'s inscription along the lower edge beneath the sitter\'s sleeve, in imitation of the artist\'s hand-writing: \'I made this after my image when I was twenty-six years old\'.\'","jpgNum":"47905.jpg"},{"id":6889,"title":"","description":"Open vault hall with bust of Charles II crowned with a wreath by Fame; Bacon seated at left holding his chancellor\'s bag; William Brouncker pointing to the inscription on the pedestal at left; books and scientific instruments on the walls in the background, with arms of the society above; landscape and country house seen through arch in the background, with man looking through telescope suspended from a tall pole, after John Evelyn; frontispiece to Thomas Sprat, \'The History of the Royal Society of London\'.  1667\\n\\nEtching","inscription":"Lettered below left \\"Evelyn inv.
